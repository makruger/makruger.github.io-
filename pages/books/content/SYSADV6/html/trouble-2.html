<a name="trouble-2"></a><h3>Kerberos Error Messages</h3>
<a name="indexterm-2644"></a><a name="indexterm-2645"></a><p>This section provides information about Kerberos error messages, including why each error occurs
and a way to fix it.</p>

<a name="trouble-4"></a><h4>SEAM Administration Tool Error Messages</h4>
<p>Unable to view the list of principals or policies; use the Name
field.</p>Cause: <p>The <tt>admin</tt> principal that you logged in with does not have the list
privilege (<tt>l</tt>) in the Kerberos ACL file (<tt>kadm5.acl</tt>). So, you cannot view the principal
list or policy list.</p>Solution: <p>You must type the principal and policy names in the Name field to
work on them, or you need to log in with a principal that
has the appropriate privileges.</p><p>JNI: Java array creation failed</p><p>JNI: Java class lookup failed</p><p>JNI: Java field lookup failed</p><p>JNI: Java method lookup failed</p><p>JNI: Java object lookup failed</p><p>JNI: Java object field lookup failed</p><p>JNI: Java string access failed</p><p>JNI: Java string creation failed</p>Cause: <p>A serious problem exists with the Java Native Interface that is used by
the SEAM Administration Tool (<tt>gkadmin</tt>).</p>Solution: <p>Exit <tt>gkadmin</tt> and restart it. If the problem persists, please report a bug.</p>

<a name="trouble-6"></a><h4>Common Kerberos Error Messages (A-M)</h4>
<p>This section provides an alphabetical list (A-M) of common error messages for the
Kerberos commands, Kerberos daemons, PAM framework, GSS interface, the NFS service, and the
Kerberos library.</p><p>All authentication systems disabled; connection refused</p>Cause: <p>This version of <tt>rlogind</tt> does not support any authentication mechanism.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that <tt>rlogind</tt> is invoked with the <tt>-k</tt> option. </p><p>Another authentication mechanism must be used to access this host</p>Cause: <p>Authentication could not be done.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the client is using Kerberos V5 mechanism for authentication.</p><p>Authentication negotiation has failed, which is required for encryption. Good bye.</p>Cause: <p>Authentication could not be negotiated with the server. </p>Solution: <p>Start authentication debugging by invoking the <tt>telnet</tt> command with the <tt>toggle authdebug</tt> command and look
at the debug messages for further clues. Also, make sure that you have
valid credentials.</p><p>Bad krb5 admin server hostname while initializing kadmin interface</p>Cause: <p>An invalid host name is configured for <tt>admin_server</tt> in the <tt>krb5.conf</tt> file.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the correct host name for the master KDC is specified
on the <tt>admin_server</tt> line in the <tt>krb5.conf</tt> file.</p><p>Bad lifetime value</p>Cause: <p>The lifetime value provided is not valid or incorrectly formatted.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the value provided is consistent with the Time Formats section
in the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2239/kinit-1?a=view"><tt>kinit</tt>(1)</a> man page.</p><p>Bad start time value</p>Cause: <p>The start time value provided is not valid or incorrectly formatted.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the value provided is consistent with the Time Formats section
in the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2239/kinit-1?a=view"><tt>kinit</tt>(1)</a> man page.</p><p>Cannot contact any KDC for requested realm</p>Cause: <p>No KDC responded in the requested realm. </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that at least one KDC (either the master or a slave)
is reachable or that the <tt>krb5kdc</tt> daemon is running on the KDCs. Check
the <tt>/etc/krb5/krb5.conf</tt> file for the list of configured KDCs (<tt>kdc =</tt> <i>kdc-name</i>).</p><p>Cannot determine realm for host</p>Cause: <p>Kerberos cannot determine the realm name for the host.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that there is a default realm name, or that the domain
name mappings are set up in the Kerberos configuration file (<tt>krb5.conf</tt>).</p><p>Cannot find KDC for requested realm</p>Cause: <p>No KDC was found in the requested realm. </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the Kerberos configuration file (<tt>krb5.conf</tt>) specifies a KDC in the
<tt>realm</tt> section.</p><p>cannot initialize realm <i>realm-name</i></p>Cause: <p>The KDC might not have a stash file.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the KDC has a stash file. If not, create a
stash file by using the <tt>kdb5_util</tt> command, and try restarting the <tt>krb5kdc</tt> command.
</p><p>Cannot resolve KDC for requested realm</p>Cause: <p>Kerberos cannot determine any KDC for the realm.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the Kerberos configuration file (<tt>krb5.conf</tt>) specifies a KDC in the
<tt>realm</tt> section.</p><p>Cannot reuse password</p>Cause: <p>The password that you specified has been used before by this principal.</p>Solution: <p>Choose a password that has not been chosen before, at least not within
the number of passwords that are kept in the KDC database for each
principal. This policy is enforced by the principal's policy.</p><p>Can't get forwarded credentials</p>Cause: <p>Credential forwarding could not be established.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the principal has forwardable credentials.</p><p>Can't open/find Kerberos configuration file</p>Cause: <p>The Kerberos configuration file (<tt>krb5.conf</tt>) was unavailable. </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the <tt>krb5.conf</tt> file is available in the correct location and
has the correct permissions. This file should be writable by <tt>root</tt> and readable
by everyone else.</p><p>Client did not supply required checksum--connection rejected</p>Cause: <p>Authentication with checksum was not negotiated with the client. The client might be
using an old Kerberos V5 protocol that does not support initial connection support.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the client is using a Kerberos V5 protocol that supports
initial connection support.</p><p>Client/server realm mismatch in initial ticket request</p>Cause: <p>A realm mismatch between the client and server occurred in the initial ticket
request. </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the server you are communicating with is in the same
realm as the client, or that the realm configurations are correct.</p><p>Client or server has a null key</p>Cause: <p>The principal has a null key.</p>Solution: <p>Modify the principal to have a non-null key by using the <tt>cpw</tt> command
of <tt>kadmin</tt>.</p><p>Communication failure with server while initializing kadmin interface</p>Cause: <p>The host that was specified for the admin server, also called the master
KDC, did not have the <tt>kadmind</tt> daemon running.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that you specified the correct host name for the master KDC.
If you specified the correct host name, make sure that <tt>kadmind</tt> is running
on the master KDC that you specified.</p><p>Credentials cache file permissions incorrect</p>Cause: <p>You do not have the appropriate read or write permissions on the credentials
cache (<tt>/tmp/krb5cc_</tt><i>uid</i><tt></tt>).</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that you have read and write permissions on the credentials cache.</p><p>Credentials cache I/O operation failed <i>XXX</i></p>Cause: <p>Kerberos had a problem writing to the system's credentials cache (<tt>/tmp/krb5cc_</tt><i>uid</i><tt></tt>).</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the credentials cache has not been removed, and that there
is space left on the device by using the <tt>df</tt> command.</p><p>Decrypt integrity check failed</p>Cause: <p>You might have an invalid ticket.</p>Solution: <p>Verify both of these conditions:</p>
<ul><li><p>Make sure that your credentials are valid. Destroy your tickets with <tt>kdestroy</tt>, and create new tickets with <tt>kinit</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that the target host has a keytab file with the correct version of the service key. Use <tt>kadmin</tt> to view the key version number of the service principal (for example, <tt>host/</tt><i>FQDN-hostname</i>) in the Kerberos database. Also, use <tt>klist</tt> <tt>-k</tt> on the target host to make sure that it has the same key version number. </p></li></ul>
<p>Encryption could not be enabled. Goodbye.</p>Cause: <p>Encryption could not be negotiated with the server.</p>Solution: <p>Start authentication debugging by invoking the <tt>telnet</tt> command with the <tt>toggle encdebug</tt> command and look
at the debug messages for further clues.</p><p>failed to obtain credentials cache</p>Cause: <p>During <tt>kadmin</tt> initialization, a failure occurred when <tt>kadmin</tt> tried to obtain credentials for the
<tt>admin</tt> principal.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that you used the correct principal and password when you executed
<tt>kadmin</tt>.</p><p>Field is too long for this implementation</p>Cause: <p>The message size that was being sent by a Kerberized application was too
long. This error could be generated if the transport protocol is UDP. which
has a default maximum message size 65535 bytes. In addition, there are limits
on individual fields within a protocol message that is sent by the Kerberos
service.</p>Solution: <p>Verify that you have not restricted the transport to UDP in the KDC
server's <tt>/etc/krb5/kdc.conf</tt> file.</p><p>GSS-API (or Kerberos) error</p>Cause: <p>This message is a generic GSS-API or Kerberos error message and can be
caused by several different problems.</p>Solution: <p>Check the <tt>/var/krb5/kdc.log</tt> file to find the more specific error message that was
logged when this error occurred.</p><p>Hostname cannot be canonicalized</p>Cause: <p>Kerberos cannot make the host name fully qualified.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the host name is defined in DNS and that the
host-name-to-address and address-to-host-name mappings are consistent.</p><p>Illegal cross-realm ticket</p>Cause: <p>The ticket sent did not have the correct cross-realms. The realms might not
have the correct trust relationships set up.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the realms you are using have the correct trust relationships.</p><p>Improper format of Kerberos configuration file</p>Cause: <p>The Kerberos configuration file has invalid entries. </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that all the relations in the <tt>krb5.conf</tt> file are followed
by the &ldquo;=&rdquo; sign and a value. Also, verify that the brackets are
present in pairs for each subsection. </p><p>Inappropriate type of checksum in message</p>Cause: <p>The message contained an invalid checksum type. </p>Solution: <p>Check which valid checksum types are specified in the <tt>krb5.conf</tt> and <tt>kdc.conf</tt> files.</p><p>Incorrect net address</p>Cause: <p>There was a mismatch in the network address. The network address in the
ticket that was being forwarded was different from the network address where the
ticket was processed. This message might occur when tickets are being forwarded.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the network addresses are correct. Destroy your tickets with <tt>kdestroy</tt>,
and create new tickets with <tt>kinit</tt>.</p><p>Invalid credential was supplied</p><p>Service key not available</p>Cause: <p>The service ticket in the credentials cache may be incorrect.</p>Solution: <p>Destroy current credential cache and rerun <tt>kinit</tt> before trying to use this
service.</p><p>Invalid flag for file lock mode</p>Cause: <p>An internal Kerberos error occurred. </p>Solution: <p>Please report a bug. </p><p>Invalid message type specified for encoding</p>Cause: <p>Kerberos could not recognize the message type that was sent by the Kerberized
application.</p>Solution: <p>If you are using a Kerberized application that was developed by your site
or a vendor, make sure that it is using Kerberos correctly.</p><p>Invalid number of character classes</p>Cause: <p>The password that you specified for the principal does not contain enough password
classes, as enforced by the principal's policy.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that you specify a password with the minimum number of password
classes that the policy requires. </p><p>KADM err: Memory allocation failure</p>Cause: <p>There is insufficient memory to run <tt>kadmin</tt>.</p>Solution: <p>Free up memory and try running <tt>kadmin</tt> again.</p><p>kadmin: Bad encryption type while changing host/&lt;FQDN&gt;'s key</p>Cause: <p>More default encryption types are included in the base release in the Solaris
10 8/07 release. Clients can request encryption types that may not be supported
by a KDC running an older version of the Solaris software.</p>Solution: <p>Several solutions exist to fix this problem. The easiest one to implement is
listed first:</p>
<ol><li><p>Add the SUNWcry and SUNWcryr packages to the KDC server. This increases the number of encryption types supported by the KDC. </p></li>
<li><p>Set <tt>permitted_enctypes</tt> in <tt>krb5.conf</tt> on the client to not include the <tt>aes256</tt> encryption type. This step will need to be done on each new client.</p></li></ol>
<p>KDC can't fulfill requested option</p>Cause: <p>The KDC did not allow the requested option.  A possible problem might
be that postdating or forwardable options were being requested, and the KDC did
not allow them. Another problem might be that you requested the renewal of
a TGT, but you didn't have a renewable TGT.</p>Solution: <p>Determine if you are either requesting an option that the KDC does not
allow or a type of ticket that is not available.</p><p>KDC policy rejects request</p>Cause: <p>The KDC policy did not allow the request. For example, the request to
the KDC did not have an IP address in its request. Or forwarding
was requested, but the KDC did not allow it.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that you are using <tt>kinit</tt> with the correct options. If necessary,
modify the policy that is associated with the principal or change the principal's
attributes to allow the request. You can modify the policy or principal by
using <tt>kadmin</tt>. </p><p>KDC reply did not match expectations</p>Cause: <p>The KDC reply did not contain the expected principal name, or other values
in the response were incorrect.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the KDC you are communicating with complies with RFC1510, that
the request you are sending is a Kerberos V5 request, or that the
KDC is available.</p><p>kdestroy: Could not obtain principal name from cache</p>Cause: <p>The credentials cache is missing or corrupted.</p>Solution: <p>Check that the cache location provided is correct. Remove and obtain a new
TGT using <tt>kinit</tt>, if necessary.</p><p>kdestroy: No credentials cache file found while destroying cache</p>Cause: <p>The credentials cache (<tt>/tmp/krb5c_</tt><i>uid</i><tt></tt>) is missing or corrupted.</p>Solution: <p>Check that the cache location provided is correct. Remove and obtain a new
TGT using <tt>kinit</tt>, if necessary.</p><p>kdestroy: TGT expire warning NOT deleted</p>Cause: <p>The credentials cache is missing or corrupted.</p>Solution: <p>Check that the cache location provided is correct. Remove and obtain a new
TGT using <tt>kinit</tt>, if necessary.</p><p>Kerberos authentication failed</p>Cause: <p>The Kerberos password is either incorrect or the password might not be synchronized
with the UNIX password.</p>Solution: <p>If the password are not synchronized, then you must specify a different password
to complete Kerberos authentication. It is possible that the user has forgotten their
original password.</p><p>Kerberos V5 refuses authentication</p>Cause: <p>Authentication could not be negotiated with the server. </p>Solution: <p>Start authentication debugging by invoking the <tt>telnet</tt> command with the <tt>toggle authdebug</tt> command and look
at the debug messages for further clues. Also, make sure that you have
valid credentials.</p><p>Key table entry not found</p>Cause: <p>No entry exists for the service principal in the network application server's keytab
file.</p>Solution: <p>Add the appropriate service principal to the server's keytab file so that it
can provide the Kerberized service.</p><p>Key version number for principal in key table is incorrect</p>Cause: <p>A principal's key version in the keytab file is different from the version
in the Kerberos database. Either a service's key has been changed, or you
might be using an old service ticket.</p>Solution: <p>If a service's key has been changed (for example, by using <tt>kadmin</tt>), you
need to extract the new key and store it in the host's keytab
file where the service is running. </p><p>Alternately, you might be using an old service ticket that has an
older key. You might want to run the <tt>kdestroy</tt> command and then the <tt>kinit</tt>
command again.</p><p>kinit: gethostname failed</p>Cause: <p>An error in the local network configuration is causing <tt>kinit</tt> to fail.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the host is configured correctly.</p><p>login: load_modules: can not open module /usr/lib/security/pam_krb5.so.1</p>Cause: <p>Either the Kerberos PAM module is missing or it is not a valid
executable binary.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the Kerberos PAM module is in the <tt>/usr/lib/security</tt> directory and
that it is a valid executable binary. Also, make sure that the <tt>/etc/pam.conf</tt>
file contains the correct path to <tt>pam_krb5.so.1</tt>.</p><p>Looping detected inside krb5_get_in_tkt</p>Cause: <p>Kerberos made several attempts to get the initial tickets but failed.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that at least one KDC is responding to authentication requests.</p><p>Master key does not match database</p>Cause: <p>The loaded database dump was not created from a database that contains the
master key. The master key is located in <tt>/var/krb5/.k5.</tt><i>REALM</i><tt></tt>.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the master key in the loaded database dump matches the
master key that is located in <tt>/var/krb5/.k5.</tt><i>REALM</i><tt></tt>.</p><p>Matching credential not found</p>Cause: <p>The matching credential for your request was not found. Your request requires credentials
that are unavailable in the credentials cache.</p>Solution: <p>Destroy your tickets with <tt>kdestroy</tt>, and create new tickets with <tt>kinit</tt>.</p><p>Message out of order</p>Cause: <p>Messages that were sent using sequential-order privacy arrived out of order. Some messages
might have been lost in transit.</p>Solution: <p>You should reinitialize the Kerberos session.</p><p>Message stream modified</p>Cause: <p>There was a mismatch between the computed checksum and the message checksum. The
message might have been modified while in transit, which can indicate a security
leak. </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the messages are being sent across the network correctly. Because
this message can also indicate the possible tampering of messages while they are
being sent, destroy your tickets using <tt>kdestroy</tt> and reinitialize the Kerberos services
that you are using.</p>

<a name="trouble-27"></a><h4>Common Kerberos Error Messages (N-Z)</h4>
<p>This section provides an alphabetical list (N-Z) of common error messages for the
Kerberos commands, Kerberos daemons, PAM framework, GSS interface, the NFS service, and the
Kerberos library.</p><p>No credentials cache file found</p>Cause: <p>Kerberos could not find the credentials cache (<tt>/tmp/krb5cc_</tt><i>uid</i><tt></tt>). </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the credential file exists and is readable. If it isn't,
try performing <tt>kinit</tt> again.</p><p>No credentials were supplied, or the credentials were unavailable or inaccessible</p><p>No credential cache found</p>Cause: <p>The user's credential cache is incorrect or does not exist.</p>Solution: <p>The user should run <tt>kinit</tt> before trying to start the service.</p><p>No credentials were supplied, or the credentials were unavailable or inaccessible</p><p>No principal in keytab matches desired name</p>Cause: <p>An error occurred while trying to authenticate the server.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the host or service principal is in the server's keytab
file.</p><p>Operation requires &ldquo;<i>privilege</i>&rdquo; privilege</p>Cause: <p>The <tt>admin</tt> principal that was being used does not have the appropriate privilege
configured in the <tt>kadm5.acl</tt> file.</p>Solution: <p>Use a principal that has the appropriate privileges. Or, configure the principal that
was being used to have the appropriate privileges by modifying the <tt>kadm5.acl</tt> file.
Usually, a principal with <tt>/admin</tt> as part of its name has the appropriate privileges.</p><p>PAM-KRB5 (auth): krb5_verify_init_creds failed: Key table entry not found</p>Cause: <p>The remote application tried to read the host's service principal in the local
<tt>/etc/krb5/krb5.keytab</tt> file, but one does not exist.</p>Solution: <p>Add the host's service principal to the host's keytab file.</p><p>Password is in the password dictionary</p>Cause: <p>The password that you specified is in a password dictionary that is being
used. Your password is not a good choice for a password.</p>Solution: <p>Choose a password that has a mix of password classes.</p><p>Permission denied in replay cache code</p>Cause: <p>The system's replay cache could not be opened. Your server might have been
first run under a user ID different than your current user ID.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the replay cache has the appropriate permissions. The replay cache
is stored on the host where the Kerberized server application is running. The
replay cache file is called <tt>/var/krb5/rcache/rc_</tt><i>service_name</i><tt>_</tt><i>uid</i><tt></tt> for non-<tt>root</tt> users. For root users
the replay cache file is called <tt>/var/krb5/rcache/root/rc_</tt><i>service_name</i><tt></tt>. </p><p>Protocol version mismatch</p>Cause: <p>Most likely, a Kerberos V4 request was sent to the KDC. The Kerberos
service supports only the Kerberos V5 protocol. </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that your applications are using the Kerberos V5 protocol.</p><p>Request is a replay</p>Cause: <p>The request has already been sent to this server and processed. The tickets
might have been stolen, and someone else is trying to reuse the tickets.
</p>Solution: <p>Wait for a few minutes, and reissue the request.</p><p>Requested principal and ticket don't match</p>Cause: <p>The service principal that you are connecting to and the service ticket that
you have do not match. </p>Solution: <p>Make sure that DNS is functioning properly. If you are using another vendor's
software, make sure that the software is using principal names correctly.</p><p>Requested protocol version not supported</p>Cause: <p>Most likely, a Kerberos V4 request was sent to the KDC. The Kerberos
service supports only the Kerberos V5 protocol.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that your applications are using the Kerberos V5 protocol.</p><p>Server refused to negotiate authentication, which is required for encryption. Good bye.</p>Cause: <p>The remote application is not capable or has been configured not to accept
Kerberos authentication from the client.</p>Solution: <p>Provide a remote application that can negotiate authentication or configure the application to
use the appropriate flags to turn on authentication.</p><p>Server refused to negotiate encryption. Good bye.</p>Cause: <p>Encryption could not be negotiated with the server.</p>Solution: <p>Start authentication debugging by invoking the <tt>telnet</tt> command with the <tt>toggle encdebug</tt>command and look at
the debug messages for further clues.</p><p>Server rejected authentication (during sendauth exchange)</p>Cause: <p>The server that you are trying to communicate with rejected the authentication. Most
often, this error occurs during Kerberos database propagation. Some common causes might be
problems with the <tt>kpropd.acl</tt> file, DNS, or the keytab file.</p>Solution: <p>If you get this error when you are running applications other than <tt>kprop</tt>,
investigate whether the server's keytab file is correct.</p><p>The ticket isn't for us</p><p>Ticket/authenticator don't match</p>Cause: <p>There was a mismatch between the ticket and the authenticator. The principal name
in the request might not have matched the service principal's name. Either because
the ticket was being sent with an FQDN name of the principal while
the service expected a non-FQDN name, or a non-FDQN name was sent when
the service expected an FQDN name.</p>Solution: <p>If you get this error when you are running applications other than <tt>kprop</tt>,
investigate whether the server's keytab file is correct.</p><p>Ticket expired</p>Cause: <p>Your ticket times have expired.</p>Solution: <p>Destroy your tickets with <tt>kdestroy</tt>, and create new tickets with <tt>kinit</tt>.</p><p>Ticket is ineligible for postdating</p>Cause: <p>The principal does not allow its tickets to be postdated.</p>Solution: <p>Modify the principal with <tt>kadmin</tt> to allow postdating.</p><p>Ticket not yet valid</p>Cause: <p>The postdated ticket is not valid yet. </p>Solution: <p>Create a new ticket with the correct date, or wait until the current
ticket is valid.</p><p>Truncated input file detected</p>Cause: <p>The database dump file that was being used in the operation is not
a complete dump file.</p>Solution: <p>Create the dump file again, or use a different database dump file.</p><p>Unable to securely authenticate user ... exit</p>Cause: <p>Authentication could not be negotiated with the server. </p>Solution: <p>Start authentication debugging by invoking the <tt>telnet</tt> command with the <tt>toggle authdebug</tt> command and look
at the debug messages for further clues. Also, make sure that you have
valid credentials.</p><p>Wrong principal in request</p>Cause: <p>There was an invalid principal name in the ticket. This error might indicate
a DNS or FQDN problem.</p>Solution: <p>Make sure that the principal of the service matches the principal in the
ticket. </p>
