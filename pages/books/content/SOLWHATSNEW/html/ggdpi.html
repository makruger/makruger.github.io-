<a name="ggdpi"></a><h3>New Features in Solaris Express Developer Edition 1/08</h3>


<a name="ggdoz"></a><h4>Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator's Procedures</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 1/08 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the Solaris Trusted Extensions packages are installed when the
Solaris OS is installed. The <tt>ExtraValue</tt> directory is no longer present. This directory previously
included the Solaris Trusted Extensions packages. The Solaris Trusted Extensions functionality is managed
by the service management facility (SMF) as the <tt>svc:/system/labeld:default</tt> service. This service must be
enabled. After the service is in the online state, reboot the system to
activate Solaris Trusted Extensions. Additional configuration is required after the reboot. For more
information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-7309/trp-part-1?a=view">Part&nbsp;I, Initial Configuration of Trusted Extensions, in <i>Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator&rsquo;s Procedures</i></a>.</p><p>The Developer 1/08 release also includes the following features:</p>
<ul><li><p>The domain of interpretation (DOI) is configurable. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-7309/tnetov-40?a=view">Network Security Attributes in Trusted Extensions in <i>Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator&rsquo;s Procedures</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The NFSv3 protocol supports multilevel mounts. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-7309/managefiles-26?a=view">Trusted Extensions Software and NFS Protocol Versions in <i>Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator&rsquo;s Procedures</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The name service cache daemon (<tt>nscd</tt>) can be separately configured per labeled zone. This configuration supports environments where each zone is connected to a subnetwork that runs at the label of the zone, and the subnetwork has its own name server for that label.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information about Solaris Trusted Extensions, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-7309"><i>Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator&rsquo;s Procedures</i></a>.</p>

<a name="ggdnp"></a><h4>Network Data Management Protocol Service</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 1/08 release.</p><p>The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) is a  standard for backing up
data, usually to tape, from network clients. With NDMP running as a
service, any NDMP-compliant data management application on the network is a client and can
back up its data to the NDMP server, a Sun StorageTek NAS
appliance.</p>

<a name="ggdpc"></a><h4>StarOffice 8</h4>
<p>This desktop tools enhancement is new in the Developer 1/08 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, StarOffice 8 has been enhanced to include a new
Chart engine.</p><p>For more information about the new Chart engine, see <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Chart2/Features2.3">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Chart2/Features2.3</a>. For more information
about StarOffice, see <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/whats_new.jsp">http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/whats_new.jsp</a>.</p>

<a name="ggdpn"></a><h4>GNOME 2.20</h4>
<p>This desktop tools enhancement is new in the Developer 1/08 release.</p><p>GNOME 2.20 is the latest version of the multi-platform desktop environment, GNOME Desktop.
GNOME 2.20 contains the following features:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Email client</b> &ndash; The email client, Evolution, contains the following features:</p>
<ul><li><p>Attachment warning</p></li>
<li><p>Email notification icon in panel's notification area</p></li>
<li><p>Backup</p></li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Magic Space Bar&rdquo;</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Text Editing</b> &ndash; Gedit, has an all-new syntax highlighting system which now supports syntax highlighting for scripting languages such as PHP and Ruby.</p></li>
<li><p><b>File Management</b> &ndash; Desktop search is integrated into the file chooser dialog. The Nautilus file manager now displays more information in the Properties window for drives, including a pie graph that displays how much space is left. In addition, you can now see the overall disk usage in the Disk Usage Analyzer utility.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Control Panel</b> &ndash; For GNOME 2.20, the control panels are reorganized slightly to reduce the number of control panels, making it easier to find what you need. For example, this release introduces Appearance control panel applet. The Theme, Background, Fonts, and Interface applets have been merged to create this new applet, simplifying the Preferences menu. In addition, some of the Accessibility preferences have been moved to a new tab in the Preferred Applications control panel.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Help System</b> &ndash; The GNOME help browser (yelp) infrastructure is modified to improve the style and layout of the help system. In addition, the colors match your current theme better. Help pages appear more quickly, as individual pages are now loaded on demand instead of the entire manual being parsed unnecessarily.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Right-To-Left Language Interfaces</b> &ndash; Right-to-left language interfaces are present for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew which are written from right to left. Users of these languages expect most user interface elements to be similarly mirrored, compared to left-to-right user interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p> <b>GTK+</b> &ndash; GNOME 2.20 uses version 2.12 of the GTK+ UI toolkit API.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Glib</b> &ndash; The Glib utility library now has a <tt>g_get_user_special_dir</tt>() that provides the path to special folders defined by FreeDesktop.org's <tt>xdg-user-dirs</tt> specification and tool. For text processing, the new GRegex API provides regular expression string matching without the need for an additional library.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Glade</b> &ndash; Starting with this release, there are user interface and architectural improvements. For example, tool windows such as the editor, the inspector, and the palette, are now dockable.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Accerciser</b> &ndash; Accerciser is an interactive Python accessibility explorer, and a replacement of at-poke.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Rarian</b> &ndash; Rarian is a documentation meta-data library, designed as a replacement for Scrollkeeper.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Gnome-devel-docs</b> &ndash;  Gnome-devel-docs is the GNOME developer documentation suite.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Poppler-data</b> &ndash; New private data is installed under <tt>/usr/share/poppler</tt> containing private encoding files for use with poppler.</p></li>
<li><p><b>GNOME Display Manager (GDM)</b> &ndash; GDM now has better <tt>utmp</tt> and <tt>wtmp</tt> auditing. GDM can also now use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access to the Shutdown, Reboot, and Suspend features.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Avahi</b> &ndash; Some GNOME applications, such as Ekiga and Rhythmbox, provide support for service discovery and registration using Avahi. The Avahi client API can be used by all GNOME applications. The Avahi daemon makes calls to the Bonjour API and uses the Bonjour server for service discovery and registration. On Linux and FreeBSD platforms, the Avahi daemon implements the mDNS stack.</p></li></ul>


<a name="ggekv"></a><h4>Enhancements to the Solaris ZFS File System</h4>
<p>This sections describes new ZFS features in the Developer 1/08 release.</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Using Cache Devices in Your ZFS Storage Pool</b> &ndash; In this Solaris release, you can create pool and specify <b>cache devices</b>, which are used to cache storage pool data.</p><p>Cache devices provide an additional layer of caching between main memory and disk. Using cache devices provide the greatest performance improvement for random read-workloads of mostly static content.</p><p>One or more cache devices can specified when the pool is created. For example:</p><pre># zpool create pool mirror c0t2d0 c0t4d0 cache c0t0d0
# zpool status pool
  pool: pool
 state: ONLINE
 scrub: none requested
config:

        NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        pool        ONLINE       0     0     0
          mirror    ONLINE       0     0     0
            c0t2d0  ONLINE       0     0     0
            c0t4d0  ONLINE       0     0     0
        cache
          c0t0d0    ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors</pre><p>After cache devices are added, they gradually fill with content from main memory. Depending on the size of your cache device, it could take over an hour for them to fill. Capacity and reads can be monitored by using the <tt>zpool iostat</tt> command as follows:</p><pre># zpool iostat -v pool 5</pre><p>Cache devices can be added or removed from the pool after the pool is created.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zpool-1m?a=view"><tt>zpool</tt>(1M)</a> and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271"><i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Enhancements to the zfs send Command</b> &ndash;  This release includes the following enhancements to the <tt>zfs send</tt> command.</p>
<ul><li><p>Send all incremental streams from one snapshot to a cumulative snapshot. For example:</p><pre># zfs list
NAME                      USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
pool                      428K  16.5G    20K  /pool
pool/fs                    71K  16.5G    21K  /pool/fs
pool/fs@snapA              16K      -  18.5K  -
pool/fs@snapB              17K      -    20K  -
pool/fs@snapC              17K      -  20.5K  -
pool/fs@snapD                0      -    21K  -
# zfs send -I pool/fs@snapA pool/fs@snapD > /snaps/fs@combo</pre><p>Send all incremental snapshots between <tt>fs@snapA</tt> to <tt>fs@snapD</tt> to <tt>fs@combo</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Send an incremental stream from the origin snapshot to create a clone. The original snapshot must already exist on the receiving side to accept the incremental stream. For example:</p><pre># zfs send -I pool/fs@snap1 pool/clone@snapA > /snaps/fsclonesnap-I
.
.
# zfs receive -F pool/clone &lt; /snaps/fsclonesnap-I</pre></li>
<li><p>Send a replication stream of all descendent file systems, up to the named snapshots. When received, all properties, snapshots, descendent file systems, and clones are preserved. For example:</p><pre>zfs send -R pool/fs@snap > snaps/fs-R</pre><p>For an extended example, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gfwqb?a=view">Sending and Receiving Complex ZFS Snapshot Streams in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Send an incremental replication stream. </p><pre>zfs send -R -[iI] @snapA pool/fs@snapD</pre><p>For an extended example, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gfwqb?a=view">Sending and Receiving Complex ZFS Snapshot Streams in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gbchx?a=view">Saving and Restoring ZFS Data in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS Quotas and Reservations for File System Data Only</b> &ndash; In addition to the existing ZFS quota and reservation features, this release includes dataset quotas and reservations that do not include descendents, such as snapshots and clones, in the space consumption accounting.</p>
<ul><li><p>The <tt>refquota</tt> property limits the amount of space a dataset can consume. This property enforces a hard limit on the amount of space that can be used. This hard limit does not include space used by descendents, such as snapshots and clones.</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>refreservation</tt> property sets the minimum amount of space that is guaranteed to a dataset, not including its descendents.</p></li></ul>
<p>For example, you can set a 10 Gbyte <tt>refquota</tt> for <tt>studentA</tt> that sets a 10-Gbyte hard limit of <b>referenced</b> space. For additional flexibility, you can set a 20-Gbyte quota that allows you to manage <tt>studentA</tt>'s snapshots.</p><pre># zfs set refquota=10g tank/studentA
# zfs set quota=20g tank/studentA</pre><p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gazvb?a=view">ZFS Quotas and Reservations in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS File System Properties for the Solaris CIFS Service</b> &ndash; This release provides support for the Solaris Common Internet File System (CIFS) service. This product provides the ability to share files between Solaris and Windows or MacOS systems.</p><p>To facilitate sharing files between these systems by using the Solaris CIFS service, the following new ZFS properties are provided:</p>
<ul><li><p>Case sensitivity support (<tt>casesensitivity</tt>)</p></li>
<li><p>Non-blocking mandatory locks (<tt>nbmand</tt>)</p></li>
<li><p>SMB share support (<tt>sharesmb</tt>)</p></li>
<li><p>Unicode normalization support (<tt>normalization</tt>)</p></li>
<li><p>UTF-8 character set support (<tt>utf8only</tt>)</p></li></ul>
<p>In addition to the ZFS properties added for supporting the Solaris CIFS software product, the <tt>vscan</tt> property is available for scanning ZFS files if you have a 3rd party virus scanning engine.</p><p>For more information about using these properties, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gayns?a=view">Managing ZFS Properties in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p><p> For more information about the Solaris CIFS service, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-2429"><i>Solaris CIFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS Storage Pool Properties</b> &ndash;  This release provides ZFS pool property information. For example:</p><pre># zpool get all users
NAME   PROPERTY     VALUE       SOURCE
users  size         16.8G       -
users  used         217M        -
users  available    16.5G       -
users  capacity     1%          -
users  altroot      -           default
users  health       ONLINE      -
users  guid         11063207170669925585  -
users  version      8           default
users  bootfs       -           default
users  delegation   on          default
users  autoreplace  off         default
users  temporary    on          local</pre>
<ul><li><p>The <tt>cachefile</tt> property &ndash; This release provides the <tt>cachefile</tt> property, which controls where pool configuration information is cached. All pools in the cache are automatically imported when the system boots. However, installation and clustering environments might need to cache this information in a different location so that pools are not automatically imported.</p><p>You can set this property to cache pool configuration in a different location that can be imported later by using the <tt>zpool import</tt> <tt>c</tt> command. For most ZFS configurations, this property would not be used.</p><p>The <tt>cachefile</tt> property is not persistent and is not stored on disk. This property replaces the <tt>temporary</tt> property that was used to indicate that pool information should not be cached in previous Solaris releases.</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>failmode</tt> property &ndash; This release provides the <tt>failmode</tt> property for determining the behavior of a catastrophic pool failure due to a loss of device connectivity or the failure of all devices in the pool. The <tt>failmode</tt> property can be set to these values: <tt>wait</tt>, <tt>continue</tt>, or <tt>panic</tt>. The default value is <tt>wait</tt>, which means you must reconnect the device or replace a failed device and clear the error with the <tt>zpool clear</tt> command.</p><p>The <tt>failmode</tt> property is set like other settable ZFS properties, which can be set either before or after the pool is created. For example:</p><pre># zpool set failmode=continue tank
# zpool get failmode tank
NAME  PROPERTY  VALUE     SOURCE
tank  failmode  continue  local</pre><pre># zpool create -o failmode=continue</pre><p>For a description of all ZFS pool properties, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gfifk?a=view">Managing ZFS Storage Pool Properties in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>ZFS and File System Mirror Mounts</b> &ndash;  In this Solaris release, NFSv4 mount enhancements are provided to make ZFS file systems more accessible to NFS clients.</p><p>When file systems are created on the NFS server, the NFS client can automatically discover these newly created file systems within their existing mount of a parent file system.</p><p>For example, if the server <tt>neo</tt> already shares the <tt>tank</tt> file system and client <tt>zee</tt> has it mounted, <tt>/tank/baz</tt> is automatically visible on the client after it is created on the server.</p><pre>zee# mount neo:/tank /mnt
zee# ls /mnt
baa    bar

neo# zfs create tank/baz

zee% ls /mnt
baa    bar    baz
zee% ls /mnt/baz
file1    file2 </pre></li></ul>

<a name="ggdrs"></a><h4>x86: Support for Suspend-to-RAM &ldquo;Sleep&rdquo; Feature</h4>
<p>This system resource enhancement is new in the Developer 1/08 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the Solaris OS includes support for the Suspend to
RAM (S3) &ldquo;Sleep&rdquo; feature. This feature is supported on Solaris x86 based platforms
that include compliant drivers, for example the Sun Ultra<sup>TM</sup> 20 M2 Workstation. For a
driver to be considered compliant, the driver must support a specific feature set.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-3196/powermgt-37437?a=view">Chapter 12, Power Management, in <i>Writing Device Drivers</i></a>.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>As platforms become compliant, they will be added to the list of supported
workstations.</p>
<hr>


<a name="ggdps"></a><h4>x86: Virtualization Using the Sun xVM Hypervisor</h4>
<p>This system resource enhancement is new in the Developer 1/08 release.</p><p>The goal of virtualization is to move from managing individual datacenter components to
managing pools of resources. By consolidating multiple hosts and services on a single
machine, virtualization reduces costs through the sharing of hardware, infrastructure, and administration.</p><p>The Sun xVM Hypervisor is based on the work of the Xen open
source community. In a running system, the Hypervisor fits between the hardware and
the operating system instance. The Hypervisor can securely execute multiple virtual machines simultaneously
on a single x86-compatible computer, with each virtual machine running its own operating
system.</p><p>Each virtual machine instance is called a domain. There are two kinds of
domains. There is one control domain, also called domain 0, or dom0.
A guest operating system is called a guest domain, also referred to as
domain U or domU. You can have multiple guest domains on your system.</p><p>Within Hypervisor based solutions, there are two basic types of virtualization, full virtualization
and paravirtualization. The Hypervisor supports both modes. A system can have both paravirtualized
and fully virtualized domains running simultaneously.</p><p>The xVM Hypervisor virtualizes the system's hardware. This means that it transparently shares
and partitions the system's resources, such as CPUs, memory, and NICs, among the
guest domains.</p><p>The Hypervisor runs on x64 and x86 based systems. Supported configurations include Solaris
dom0, and Solaris domU, Linux domU, FreeBSD domU, and Windows domU guests. Solaris
zones and branded zones can be run within a Solaris domU.</p><p>For more information, see the following:</p>

<p>This device management enhancement is new in the Developer 1/08 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the Solaris OS includes a new device retirement mechanism
to isolate a device as <b>faulty</b> by the fault management framework (FMA). This
feature allows faulty devices to be safely and automatically inactivated to avoid data
loss, data corruption, or panics and system down time. The retirement process is
done safely, taking into account the stability of the system after the device
has been retired.</p><p>Critical devices are never retired. If you need to manually replace a retired
device, use the <tt>fmadm repair</tt> command after the device replacement so that system knows
that the device is replaced, in addition to the manual replacement steps.</p><p>The <tt>fmadm</tt> repair process is as follows:</p>
<ul><li><p>Identify the faulted device with the <tt>fmadm faulty</tt> <tt>-a</tt> command.</p><pre># fmadm faulty

   STATE RESOURCE / UUID

-------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

faulty   &lt;<i>fmri</i>></pre></li>
<li><p>Clear the fault by using the <tt>fmadm repair</tt> command.</p><pre># fmadm repair &lt;<i>fmri</i>></pre></li>
<li><p>Run the <tt>fmadm faulty</tt> command again to be sure the fault is cleared.</p><pre># fmadm faulty -a
   STATE RESOURCE / UUID</pre></li></ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/fmadm-1m?a=view"><tt>fmadm</tt>(1M)</a>.</p><p>A general message regarding device retirement is displayed on the console and written
to the <tt>/var/adm/messages</tt> file so that you aware of a retired device. For
example:</p><pre>Aug 9 18:14 starbug genunix: [ID 751201 kern.notice] 
NOTICE: One or more I/O devices have been retired</pre><p>You can use the <tt>prtconf</tt> command to identify specific retired devices. For example:</p><pre># prtconf
