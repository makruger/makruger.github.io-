<a name="gbiom"></a><h3>New Features in Solaris Express 12/05</h3>
<p>This section describes all features that are new or have been enhanced in
the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p>

<a name="gbjpv"></a><h4>The ZFS File System</h4>
<p>This file system enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>This Solaris Express release includes ZFS, a new 128-bit file system. ZFS provides
simple administration, transactional semantics, end-to-end data integrity, and immense scalability. ZFS is not
an incremental improvement to existing technology. Rather, ZFS is a fundamentally new approach
to data management.</p><p>ZFS uses a pooled-storage model that completely eliminates the concept of volumes. Thus,
ZFS eliminates the associated problems of partition management, provisioning, and growing file systems.
Thousands of file systems can all draw from a common storage pool. Each
system consumes only as much space as actually needed. The combined I/O bandwidth
of all devices in the pool is available to all file systems at
all times.</p><p>All operations are &ldquo;copy-on-write&rdquo; transactions, so the on-disk state is always valid. Every
block has a checksum, so silent data corruption is impossible. In addition, the
data is self-healing in replicated configurations. This feature means that if one copy
is damaged, ZFS detects the damage and uses another copy to repair the
damaged copy.</p>

<a name="gbjoj"></a><h5>ZFS is Easy to Administer</h5>
<p>For system administrators, the greatest improvement of ZFS over traditional file systems is
the ease of administration.</p><p>ZFS takes a single command to set up a mirrored storage pool
and file system. For example:</p><pre># zpool create home mirror c0t1d0 c1t2d0</pre><p>The above command creates a mirrored storage pool named <tt>home</tt> and a single
file system named <tt>home</tt>. The file system is mounted at <tt>/home</tt>.</p><p>With ZFS, you can use whole disks instead of partitions to create
the storage pool.</p><p>Then, you can use the <tt>/home</tt> file system hierarchy to create any number
of file systems beneath <tt>/home</tt>. For example:</p><pre># zfs create home/user1</pre><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zpool-1m?a=view"><tt>zpool</tt>(1M)</a> and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zfs-1m?a=view"><tt>zfs</tt>(1M)</a> man pages.</p><p>In addition, ZFS provides the following administration features:</p>
<ul><li><p>Backup and restore capabilities</p></li>
<li><p>Device management support</p></li>
<li><p>Persistent snapshots and cloning features</p></li>
<li><p>Quotas that can be set for file systems</p></li>
<li><p>RBAC-based access control</p></li>
<li><p>Storage pool space reservations for file systems</p></li>
<li><p>Support for Solaris systems that have zones installed</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271"><i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gcwra"></a><h5>ZFS Command Improvements and Changes</h5>
<p>The following section describes recent improvements and changes to the ZFS command interface
in the Solaris Express release.</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Clearing device errors</b> &ndash;  You can use the <tt>zpool clear</tt> command to clear error counts associated with a device or the pool. Previously, error counts were cleared when a device in a pool was brought online with the <tt>zpool online</tt> command.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Compact NFSv4 ACL format</b> &ndash; Three NFSv4 ACL formats are available: verbose, positional, and compact. The new compact and positional ACL formats are available to set and display ACLs. You can use the <tt>chmod</tt> command to set all 3 ACL formats. Use the <tt>ls</tt> <tt>-V</tt> command to display compact and positional ACL formats and the <tt>ls</tt> <tt>-v</tt> command to display verbose ACL formats.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Double Parity RAID-Z</b> (<tt>raidz2</tt>) &ndash; A replicated RAID-Z configuration can now have either single- or double-parity, which means that one or two device failures can be sustained respectively, without any data loss. You can specify the <tt>raidz2</tt> keyword for a double-parity RAID-Z configuration. Or, you can specify the <tt>raidz</tt> or <tt>raidz1</tt> keyword for a single-parity RAID-Z configuration.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Hot spares for ZFS storage pool devices</b> &ndash; The ZFS hot spares feature enables you to identify disks that could be used to replace a failed or faulted device in one or more storage pools. Designating a device as a <b>hot spare</b> means that if an active device in the pool fails, the hot spare automatically replaces the failed device. Or, you can manually replace a device in a storage pool with a hot spare.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Replacing a ZFS File System With a ZFS Clone</b> (<tt>zfs promote</tt>) &ndash; The <tt>zfs promote</tt> command enables you to replace an existing ZFS file system with a clone of that file system. This feature is helpful when you want to run tests on an alternative version of a file system and then, make that alternative version of the file system the active file system.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Recovering destroyed pools</b> &ndash; The <tt>zpool import</tt> <tt>-D</tt> command enables you to recover pools that were previously destroyed with the <tt>zpool destroy</tt> command.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Temporarily take a device offline</b> &ndash; You can use the <tt>zpool offline</tt> <tt>-t</tt> command to take a device offline temporarily. When the system is rebooted, the device is automatically returned to the <tt>ONLINE</tt> state.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Upgrading ZFS Storage Pools</b> (<tt>zpool upgrade</tt>) &ndash; You can upgrade your storage pools to a newer version to take advantage of the latest features by using the <tt>zpool upgrade</tt> command. In addition, the <tt>zpool status</tt> command has been modified to notify you when your pools are running older versions.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS backup and restore commands are renamed</b> &ndash; The <tt>zfs backup</tt> and <tt>zfs restore</tt> commands are renamed to <tt>zfs send</tt> and <tt>zfs receive</tt> to more accurately describe their function. The function of these commands is to save and restore ZFS data stream representations.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS and zones improvements</b> &ndash; On a Solaris system with zones installed, you can use the <tt>zoneadm clone</tt> feature to copy the data from an existing source ZFS <tt>zonepath</tt> to a target ZFS <tt>zonepath</tt> on your system. You cannot use the ZFS clone feature to clone the non-global zone. You must use the <tt>zoneadm clone</tt> command. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2450"><i>System Administration Guide: Virtualization Using the Solaris Operating System</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS is integrated with Fault Manager</b> &ndash; A ZFS diagnostic engine is included that is capable of diagnosing and reporting pool failures and device failures. Checksum, I/O, and device errors associated with pool or device failures are also reported. Diagnostic error information is written to the console and the <tt>/var/adm/messages</tt> file. In addition, detailed information about recovering from a reported error can be displayed by using the <tt>zpool status</tt> command.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information about these improvements and changes, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271"><i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gbshc"></a><h5>ZFS Web-Based Management</h5>
<p>The Solaris Express 1/06 release includes the ZFS web-based management tool, which enables
you to perform much of the administration that you can do with the
ZFS command line interface. You can perform the following administrative tasks with the
ZFS Administration console:</p>
<ul><li><p>Create a new storage pool.</p></li>
<li><p>Add capacity to an existing pool.</p></li>
<li><p>Move (export) a storage pool to another system. </p></li>
<li><p>Import a previously exported storage pool to make it available on another system.</p></li>
<li><p>View information about storage pools.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a file system.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a volume.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a snapshot of a file system or a volume.</p></li>
<li><p>Roll back a file system to a previous snapshot.</p></li></ul>
<p>You can access the ZFS Administration console through a secure web browser at
the following URL:</p><pre>https://<i>system-name</i>:6789</pre><p>If you type the appropriate URL and are unable to reach ZFS
Administration console, the server might not be started. To start the server, run
the following command:</p><pre># /usr/sbin/smcwebserver start</pre><p>If you want the server to run automatically when the system boots,
run the following command:</p><pre># /usr/sbin/smcwebserver enable</pre>

<a name="gbkbo"></a><h5>ZFS and Solaris Zones</h5>
<p>The Solaris Zones partitioning technology supports ZFS components, such as adding ZFS file
systems and storage pools into a zone.</p><p>For example, the file system resource type in the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command has been
enhanced as follows:</p><pre>zonecfg:myzone> add fs
zonecfg:myzone:fs> set type=zfs
zonecfg:myzone:fs> set dir=/export/share
zonecfg:myzone:fs> set special=tank/home
zonecfg:myzone:fs> end</pre><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zonecfg-1m?a=view"><tt>zonecfg</tt>(1M)</a> man page and the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271"><i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gbkcu"></a><h5>Solaris Installation Tool Support of ZFS File Systems</h5>
<p>In this release, the following Solaris installation tool support is provided:</p>
<ul><li><p>Custom Solaris Jumpstart - You cannot include ZFS file systems in a Jumpstart profile. However, you can run following scripts from a ZFS storage pool to set up an install server or an install client:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>setup_install_server</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>add_install_server</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>add_install_client</tt></p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>Solaris Live Upgrade - Preserves your original boot environment and carries over your ZFS storage pools into the new environment. Currently, ZFS cannot be used as a bootable root file system. Therefore, your existing ZFS file systems are not copied into the boot environment (BE).</p></li>
<li><p>Solaris Initial Install - ZFS file systems are not recognized during an initial installation. However, if you do not specify any of the disk devices that contain ZFS storage pools to be used for the installation, you should be able to recover your storage pools by using the <tt>zpool import</tt> command after the installation. For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zpool-1m?a=view"><tt>zpool</tt>(1M)</a> man page.</p><p>As with most reinstallation scenarios, you should back up your ZFS files before proceeding with the initial installation option.</p></li>
<li><p>Solaris Upgrade &ndash; Your ZFS file systems and storage pools are preserved.</p></li></ul>


<a name="gbjpc"></a><h5>New Solaris ACL Model</h5>
<p>ZFS implements a new ACL model. Previous versions of the Solaris OS only
supported an ACL model that was primarily based on the POSIX ACL
draft specification. The POSIX-draft based ACLs are used to protect UFS  files. A
new model that is based on the NFSv4 specification is used to
 protect ZFS files.</p><p>The main features of the new ACL model are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><p>Is based on the NFSv4 specification and the new ACLs that are similar to NT-style ACLs.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a more granular set of access privileges.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses the <tt>chmod</tt> and <tt>ls</tt> commands rather than the <tt>setfacl</tt> and <tt>getfacl</tt> commands to set and display ACLs.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides richer inheritance semantics for designating how access privileges are applied from directory to subdirectories, and so on.</p></li></ul>
<p>The recently revised <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2239/chmod-1?a=view"><tt>chmod</tt>(1)</a> man page adds many new examples that demonstrate usage
with ZFS. The <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2252/acl-5?a=view"><tt>acl</tt>(5)</a> man page has an overview of the new ACL
model. In addition, the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271"><i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a> provides extensive examples of using ACLs to protect
ZFS files.</p>

<a name="gbiqd"></a><h4>IPv6 for IP Filter</h4>
<p>This security enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>Solaris IP Filter has been enhanced to include IPv6 packet filtering. IPv6 packet
filtering can filter based on the source IPv6 address, destination address, <tt>poolsl</tt> containing
IPv6 addresses, and IPv6 extension headers.</p><p>The <tt>-6</tt> option has been added to the <tt>ipf</tt> command for use with
IPv6. Use the <tt>-6</tt> option to load and flush IPv6 packet filtering rules.
The <tt>ipstat</tt> command also has a <tt>-6</tt> option, which is used to
display IPv6 statistics.</p><p>Although there is no change to the command line interface for the
<tt>ipmon</tt> and <tt>ippool</tt> commands, these commands also support IPv6. The <tt>ipmon</tt> command has
been enhanced to accommodate the logging of IPv6 packets. The <tt>ippool</tt> command supports the
creation of IPv6 pools.</p><p>You can use the <tt>ipf6.conf</tt> file to create packet filtering rule sets for
IPv6.  By  default, the <tt>ipf6.conf</tt> configuration file is included in the
<tt>/etc/ipf</tt> directory. As with the other filtering configuration files, the <tt>ipf6.conf</tt> file loads automatically
during the boot process when it is stored in the <tt>/etc/ipf</tt> directory.</p><p>For further information about Solaris IP, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-3000"><i>System Administration Guide: IP Services</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gbiqw"></a><h4>Support for Descriptive Names in Solaris Volume Manager</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>Descriptive names for both volumes and hot spare pools enable system administrators to
name volumes and hot spare pools by using any name that follows the
naming guidelines. Additionally, the <tt>-D</tt> option has been added to the <tt>metstat</tt> command.
This option enables the user to list volumes and to list hot spare
pools with descriptive names.</p><p>For more information, see the <i>Solaris Volume Manager Administration Guide</i>.</p>

<a name="gbiqm"></a><h4>PKCS #11 v2.20 Support in the Solaris Cryptographic Framework</h4>
<p>This security enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>This feature adds RSA PKCS #11 v2.20 support to the Solaris Cryptographic Framework,
including the stronger SHA2 algorithms.</p><p>For a list of mechanisms that v2.20  provides, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2252/pkcs11-softtoken-5?a=view"><tt>pkcs11_softtoken</tt>(5)</a>
man page. For a list of mechanisms that are available to users, see
the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2239/digest-1?a=view"><tt>digest</tt>(1)</a> and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2239/mac-1?a=view"><tt>mac</tt>(1)</a> man pages.</p>

<a name="gbirg"></a><h4>UDP and TCP Performance Enhancement</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>Performance of both the TCP protocol and the UDP protocol has been
enhanced in this release. The enhancements result in lower latency and higher throughput for
both transmit and receive performance. Network applications yield better performance due to system
performance improvements. In particular, those applications which heavily transmit and receive UDP packets
or utilize TCP loopback connections show greatest benefit.</p><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2254/ip-7p?a=view"><tt>ip</tt>(7P)</a>, <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2254/tcp-7p?a=view"><tt>tcp</tt>(7P)</a>, and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2254/udp-7p?a=view"><tt>udp</tt>(7P)</a> man pages. See
also the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2724"><i>Solaris Tunable Parameters Reference Manual</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gbirb"></a><h4>Zone Rename Feature in Solaris Containers Technology</h4>
<p>This system resources enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>The zone name is now an attribute that can be set through
the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command. See the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zonecfg-1m?a=view"><tt>zonecfg</tt>(1M)</a> man page for the procedure to change
the name of a zone.</p><p>Only zones in the configured state or the installed state can be
renamed. For information about zones states, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2252/zones-5?a=view"><tt>zones</tt>(5)</a> man page.</p>

<a name="gbirz"></a><h4>Advanced DDI Interrupt Framework</h4>
<p>This device management enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>The Solaris OS provides a new DDI interrupt framework for registering interrupts and
for deregistering interrupts. Support for Message Signaled Interrupts (MSIs) is also provided. Management
interfaces enable you to manipulate priorities and capabilities, to perform interrupt masking, and
to obtain pending information.</p><p>For a list of the new interfaces, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-3196/ddidkisvc-30?a=view">Interrupt Functions in <i>Writing Device Drivers</i></a>. For a list
of interrupt functions that are obsolete and should not be used, see the
&ldquo;B-3 Deprecated Interrupt Functions&rdquo; table within this section.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-3196/interrupt-15678?a=view">Chapter 8, Interrupt Handlers, in <i>Writing Device Drivers</i></a>. See also the individual man pages for the
interfaces. All man pages for these interfaces are in the 9F man page
section.</p>

<a name="gbiqp"></a><h4>VLAN Support with <tt>xge</tt> 10Gb Ethernet Driver</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>VLAN support with <tt>xge</tt> enables system administrators to configure Virtual LAN over a
10-Gbyte Ethernet. This enhancement is the first VLAN implementation with 10-Gbyte Ethernet driver
in the Solaris OS. The <tt>dladm</tt> command can be used to configure VLAN
with great flexibility.</p><p>For further information and VLAN configuration instructions, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/dladm-1m?a=view"><tt>dladm</tt>(1M)</a> man page.</p>

<a name="gbiqr"></a><h4>Core Kerberos Mechanism Resync with MIT 1.4</h4>
<p>This security enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>The Kerberos_V5 GSS mechanism library has been synced with MIT Kerberos 1.4.0. This
version includes fine-grained multithread support.</p>

<a name="gbisg"></a><h4>SPARC: Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0.1</h4>
<p>This desktop enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>In this release, Adobe<sup>&reg;</sup>
				  Acrobat Reader is updated from version 5.0 to version
7.0.1. Adobe Reader enables you to view, navigate, and print Portable Document Format
(PDF) files. This enhancement is for the SPARC platform.</p>

<a name="gbirl"></a><h4><tt>rge</tt> Driver</h4>
<p>This driver support is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release. The
<tt>rge</tt> driver provides support for Realtek RTL8169S/8110S Gigabit Ethernet devices.</p><p>For further information, refer to the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2254/rge-7d?a=view"><tt>rge</tt>(7D)</a> man page.</p>

<a name="gbiqq"></a><h4>New UTF-8 Locales</h4>
<p>This language support enhancement is new in the Solaris Express 12/05 release.</p><p>Over 50 new UTF-8 locales have been introduced in this release. As
a result, Unicode support is now provided for all European, Middle Eastern, and Asian
(EMEA) locales which lack a UTF-8 charset variant. Furthermore, locales for Cyprus, Luxembourg,
and Malta are now available for the first time. Therefore, locales for all
25 European Union (EU) member states are now supported.</p>
