<a name="gekga"></a><h4>Solaris Live Upgrade</h4>
<p>This installation enhancement is new in the Developer 2/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, Solaris Live Upgrade has been changed with the following
enhancements:</p>
<ul><li><p>You can upgrade the Solaris OS when non-global zones are installed on a system by using Solaris Live Upgrade.</p></li>
<li><p>A new package, <tt>SUNWlucfg</tt>, must be installed with the other Solaris Live Upgrade packages <tt>SUNWlur</tt> and <tt>SUNWluu</tt>.</p><p>These three packages comprise the software needed to upgrade by using Solaris Live Upgrade. These packages include existing software, new features, and bug fixes. If you do not install these packages on your system before using Solaris Live Upgrade, upgrading to the target release fails.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information about upgrading when non-global zones are installed on a system,
see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2395"><i>Solaris Express Installation Guide: Solaris Live Upgrade and Upgrade Planning</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gezaa"></a><h4>x86: Keyboard Configuration Automated</h4>
<p>Starting with this release, the <tt>sysidkbd</tt> tool configures your USB language and its
corresponding keyboard layout on x86 systems.</p><p>With the new <tt>sysidkbd</tt> tool, the following procedure occurs:</p>
<ul><li><p>If the keyboard is self-identifying, the keyboard language and layout automatically configures during installation.</p></li>
<li><p>If the keyboard is not self-identifying, the <tt>sysidkbd</tt> tool provides you with a list of supported keyboard layouts during installation, so that you can select a layout for keyboard configuration.</p></li></ul>
<p>Previously, the USB keyboard assumed a self-identifying value of one during the installation.
Therefore, all of the keyboards that were not self-identifying always configured for a
U.S. English keyboard layout during installation on SPARC.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>PS/2 keyboards are not self-identifying. You will have to select the keyboard layout
during the installation.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>JumpStart Specifications:</b> If the keyboard is not self-identifying and you want to prevent being
prompted during your JumpStart installation, select the keyboard language in your <tt>sysidcfg</tt> file.
For JumpStart installation, the default is for a U.S. English keyboard layout. To
select another language and its corresponding keyboard layout, set the keyboard keyword in
your <tt>sysidcfg</tt> file .</p><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2394"><i>Solaris Express Installation Guide: Network-Based Installations</i></a>.</p><p>This feature was introduced for SPARC systems in the Solaris Express 10/06 release.
See <a href="gdvqq.html#gdvqd">SPARC: New <tt>sysidkbd</tt> Tool Configures Your Keyboard</a>.</p>

<a name="gekfw"></a><h4>Upgrading the Solaris OS When Non-Global Zones Are Installed</h4>
<p>This installation enhancement is new in the Developer 2/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, you can upgrade the Solaris OS when non-global zones
are installed.<a name="indexterm-1"></a><a name="indexterm-2"></a></p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The only limitation to upgrading involves a Solaris Flash archive. When you use
a Solaris Flash archive to install, an archive that contains non-global zones is
not properly installed on your system.</p>
<hr>
<p>The following changes accommodate systems that have non-global zones installed:</p>
<ul><li><p>For the Solaris interactive installation program, you can upgrade or patch a system when non-global zones are installed. The time to upgrade or patch might be extensive, depending on the number of non-global zones that are installed.</p></li>
<li><p>For an automated JumpStart installation, you can upgrade or patch with any keyword that applies to an upgrade or patching. The time to upgrade or patch might be extensive, depending on the number of non-global zones that are installed.</p></li>
<li><p>For Solaris Live Upgrade, you can upgrade or patch a system that contains non-global zones. If you have a system that contains non-global zones, Solaris Live Upgrade is the recommended upgrade program or program to add patches. Other upgrade programs might require extensive upgrade time, because the time required to complete the upgrade increases linearly with the number of installed non-global zones. If you are patching a system with Solaris Live Upgrade, you do not have to take the system to single-user mode and you can maximize your system's uptime.</p><p>Solaris Live Upgrade creates a copy of the OS on the inactive boot environment. The inactive boot environment can be upgraded or patched when non-global zones are installed. The inactive boot environment can then be booted to become the new boot environment. The following changes accommodate systems that have non-global zones installed:</p>
<ul><li><p>A new package, <tt>SUNWlucfg</tt>, must be installed with the other Solaris Live Upgrade packages, <tt>SUNWlur</tt> and <tt>SUNWluu</tt>. This package is required for any system, not just a system with non-global zones installed.</p><p>These three packages contain the software needed to upgrade by using Solaris Live Upgrade. These packages include existing software, new features, and bug fixes. If you do not install these packages on your system before using Solaris Live Upgrade, upgrading to the target release fails.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a new boot environment from the currently running boot environment remains the same with one exception. This exception occurs under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li><p>If in the current boot environment the <tt>zonecfg add fs</tt> command was used to create a separate file system for a non-global zone</p></li>
<li><p>If this separate file system resides on a shared file system. For example, <tt>/zone/root/export</tt></p></li></ul>
<p>To prevent this separate file system from being shared in the new boot environment, the <tt>lucreate</tt> command now enable you to specify a destination slice for a separate file system for a non-global zone. The argument to the <tt>-m</tt> option has a new optional field, <i>zonename</i>. This new field places the non-global zone's separate file system on a separate slice in the new boot environment.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>By default, any file system other than the critical file systems, that is, root (<tt>/</tt>), <tt>/usr</tt>, and <tt>/opt</tt> file systems, is shared between the current and new boot environments. The <tt>/export</tt> file system is a shared file system. If you use the <tt>-m</tt> option, the non-global zone's file system is placed on a separate slice and data is not shared. The <tt>-m</tt> option prevents zone file systems that were created with the <tt>zonecfg add fs</tt> command from being shared between the boot environments. See <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zonecfg-1m?a=view"><tt>zonecfg</tt>(1M)</a> for details.</p>
<hr>
<p>In this example, a new boot environment named <tt>newbe</tt> is created. The root (<tt>/)</tt> file system is copied to <tt>c0t1d0s4</tt>. All non-global zones in the current boot environment are copied to the new boot environment. The non-global zone named <tt>zone1</tt> contains a file system that resides on a separate slice in a shared file system such as <tt>/zone1/root/export</tt>. To prevent this file system from being shared, the file system is copied to a separate slice on <tt>newbe</tt>, <tt>c0t1d0s1</tt>.</p><pre># <tt><b>lucreate -n newbe -m /:/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s4:ufs</b></tt> \
<tt><b>-m /export:/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s1:ufs:zone1</b></tt></pre></li>
<li><p>The <tt>lumount</tt> command provides non-global zones with access to their corresponding file systems that exist on inactive boot environments. When the global zone administrator uses the <tt>lumount</tt> command to mount an inactive boot environment, the boot environment is also mounted for non-global zones.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing boot environments is enhanced. The <tt>lucompare</tt> command now generates a comparison of boot environments that includes the contents of any non-global zone.</p></li>
<li><p>Listing file systems with the <tt>lufslist</tt> command is enhanced to display a list of file systems for both the global zone and the non-global zones.</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>

<a name="gdytt"></a><h4>Solaris Key Management Framework</h4>
<p>This security enhancement is new in the Developer 2/07 release.</p><p>The <tt>pktool</tt> command enables the administrator to manage PKI objects in all three
keystores from a single utility.</p><p>The API layer enables the developer to specify the type of keystore to
be used. KMF also provides plug-in modules for these PKI technologies. These plug-in
modules enable developers to write new applications to use any of the supported
keystores.</p><p>KMF has a unique feature that provides a system-wide policy database that KMF
applications can use regardless of the type of keystore. By using the <tt>kmfcfg</tt>
command, the administrator can create policy definitions in a global database. KMF applications
can then choose a policy to enforce, so that all subsequent KMF operations
are constrained by the policy being enforced. Policy definitions include rules for the
following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Strategy for performing validations</p></li>
<li><p>Key usage and extended key usage requirements</p></li>
<li><p>Trust anchor definitions</p></li>
<li><p>OCSP parameters</p></li>
<li><p>CRL DB parameters (for example, location)</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information, see the following:</p>

<a name="geyze"></a><h4><tt>rsync</tt></h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 2/07 release.</p><p><tt>rsync</tt> is an open source utility that provides fast and incremental file transfer.
This utility is used by system administrators to move, copy, synchronize data both
local, and over the network. The <tt>rsync</tt> utility uses SSH as a
secure transport between machines. <tt>rsync</tt> can also be used as a safe
remote data backup tool for both full and incremental directory comparisons and transfers.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">http://rsync.samba.org/</a>.</p>

<a name="gekep"></a><h4><tt>sharemgr</tt>(1M) and <tt>sharectl</tt>(1M) Utilities</h4>
<p>This system administration tools enhancement is new in the Developer 2/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, you can use two new utilities to manage file
systems and file-sharing protocols:</p>
<ul><li><p>The <tt>sharemgr</tt> utility simplifies tasks related to sharing file systems. For example, when using <tt>sharemgr</tt> to share file systems, to set the property values for shared file systems, or perform related tasks, you do not need to use the share, <tt>shareall</tt>, or <tt>unshare</tt> utility. Additionally, you do not need to edit the <tt>/etc/dfs/dfstab</tt> file.</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>sharectl</tt> utility enables you to configure and manage file-sharing protocols, for example, NFS. This utility enables you to set the client and server operational properties, display property values for a specific protocol, and obtain the status of a protocol.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information, see the following:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/sharemgr-1m?a=view"><tt>sharemgr</tt>(1M)</a> man page</p></li>

<a name="gekfq"></a><h4>Name Service Switch Enhancements</h4>
<p>This system administration tools enhancement is new in the Developer 2/07 release.</p><p>Enhancements have been made to the name service switch (nss) and to the
Name Switch Cache Daemon (<tt>nscd</tt>(1M)) in order to deliver new functionality. These enhancements
include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Better caching in <tt>nscd</tt>(1M) and management of connections within the updated framework</p></li>
<li><p>Name service lookups that are access controlled at the naming service on a per-user basis. The updated switch framework adds support for this style of lookups using <tt>SASL</tt>/<tt>GSS</tt>/<tt>Kerberos</tt> in a manner that is compatible with the authentication model used in the Microsoft Active Directory.</p></li>
<li><p>A framework for the future addition of <tt>putXbyY</tt> interfaces.</p></li></ul>


<a name="gekfg"></a><h4>SMF Enhancements to Routing Management</h4>
<p>This system administration tools enhancement is new in the Developer 2/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, <tt>routeadm</tt> (1M) is enhanced to manage SMF-based routing daemon
services. Also, service conversions for the following commands are provided:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/in.routed-1m?a=view"><tt>in.routed</tt>(1M)</a></p></li>
