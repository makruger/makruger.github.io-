<a name="gfvmx"></a><h4>Solaris ZFS File System Features</h4>
<p>This section describes new ZFS features in the Solaris Express Developer Edition 9/07
release.</p>
<ul><li><p><b>ZFS command history enhancements (zpool history)</b> &ndash; The <tt>zpool history</tt> command has been enhanced with new options that provide ZFS file system event logging and a long format that includes the user name, the hostname, and the zone in which the operation was performed.</p><p>For example, the <tt>zpool history</tt> <tt>-i</tt> option provides <tt>zpool</tt> command events and <tt>zfs</tt> command events.</p><pre># zpool history -i users
History for 'users':
2007-04-26.12:44:02 zpool create users mirror c0t8d0 c0t9d0 c0t10d0
2007-04-26.12:46:13 zfs create users/home
2007-04-26.12:46:18 zfs create users/home/markm
2007-04-26.12:46:23 zfs create users/home/marks
2007-04-26.12:46:30 zfs create users/home/neil
2007-04-26.12:47:15 zfs snapshot -r users/home@yesterday
2007-04-26.12:54:50 zfs snapshot -r users/home@today
2007-04-26.13:29:13 zfs create users/snapshots</pre><p>The <tt>zpool history</tt> <tt>-l</tt> option provides a long format. For example:</p><pre># zpool history -l tank
History for 'tank':
2007-07-19.10:55:13 zpool create tank mirror c0t1d0 c0t11d0
[user root on neo:global]
2007-07-19.10:55:19 zfs create tank/cindys
[user root on neo:global]
2007-07-19.10:55:49 zfs allow cindys create,destroy,mount,snapshot tank/cindys
[user root on neo:global]
2007-07-19.10:56:24 zfs create tank/cindys/data
[user cindys on neo:global]</pre><p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zpool-1m?a=view"><tt>zpool</tt>(1M)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Upgrading ZFS File Systems (zfs upgrade)</b> &ndash; Starting with this release, the <tt>zfs upgrade</tt> command is included to provide future file system enhancements to existing ZFS file systems. ZFS storage pools have a similar upgrade feature to provide pool enhancements to existing storage pools.</p><p>For example:</p><pre># zfs upgrade
This system is currently running ZFS filesystem version 2.

The following filesystems are out of date, and can be upgraded.  After being
upgraded, these filesystems (and any 'zfs send' streams generated from
subsequent snapshots) will no longer be accessible by older software versions.

VER  FILESYSTEM
---  ------------
  1   datab
  1   datab/users
  1   datab/users/area51</pre><p>However, no new ZFS file system upgrade features are provided in this release.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS delegated administration</b> &ndash; Starting with this release, you can delegate fine-grained permissions to perform ZFS administration tasks to non-privileged users. You can use the <tt>zfs allow</tt> and <tt>zfs unallow</tt> commands to grant and remove permissions.</p><p>The following example shows how to set permissions so that user <tt>cindys</tt> can create, destroy, mount and take snapshots on <tt>tank/cindys</tt>. The permissions on <tt>tank/cindys</tt> are also displayed.</p><pre># zfs allow cindys create,destroy,mount,snapshot tank/cindys
# zfs allow tank/cindys
       -------------------------------------------------------------
         Local+Descendent permissions on (tank/cindys)
                 user cindys create,destroy,mount,snapshot
       -------------------------------------------------------------</pre><p>Because the <tt>tank/cindys</tt> mount point permission is set to 755 by default, user <tt>cindys</tt> will be unable to mount file systems under <tt>tank/cindys</tt>. Set an ACL similar to the following syntax to provide mount point access.</p><pre># chmod A+user:cindys:add_subdirectory:allow /tank/cindys</pre><p>You can modify the ability to use ZFS delegated administration with the pool's <tt>delegation</tt> property. For example:</p><pre># zpool get delegation users
NAME  PROPERTY    VALUE       SOURCE
users  delegation  on          default
# zpool set delegation=off users
# zpool get delegation users
NAME  PROPERTY    VALUE       SOURCE
users  delegation  off         local</pre><p>By default, the <tt>delegation</tt> property is enabled.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gbchv?a=view">Chapter 8, ZFS Delegated Administration, in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Setting up separate ZFS logging devices</b> &ndash; The ZFS intent log (ZIL) is provided to satisfy POSIX requirements for synchronous transactions. For example, databases often require their transactions to be on stable storage devices when returning from a system call. NFS and other applications can also use fsync() to ensure data stability. By default, the ZIL is allocated from blocks within the main storage pool. However, better performance might be possible by using separate intent log devices in your ZFS storage pool, such as with NVRAM or a dedicated disk.</p><p>Log devices for the ZFS intent log are not related to database log files.</p><p>You can set up separate ZFS logging devices in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li><p>When the ZFS storage pool is created or after the pool is created.</p></li>
<li><p>You can attach a log device to an existing log device to create a mirrored log device. This operation is identical to attaching a device in a unmirrored storage pool.</p></li></ul>
<p>For examples on setting up log devices, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gffyt?a=view">Creating a ZFS Storage Pool with Log Devices in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a> and<a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gazgw?a=view">Adding Devices to a Storage Pool in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p><p>For information about whether using separate ZFS logging devices is appropriate for your environment, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271/gfgaa?a=view">Setting Up Separate ZFS Logging Devices in <i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Creating intermediate ZFS datasets</b> &ndash; You can use the <tt>-p</tt> option with the <tt>zfs create</tt>, <tt>zfs clone</tt>, and <tt>zfs rename</tt> commands to quickly create a non-existent intermediate dataset, if it doesn't already exist.</p><p>For example, create ZFS datasets (<tt>users/area51</tt>) in the <tt>datab</tt> storage pool.</p><pre># zfs list
NAME                        USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT
datab                       106K  16.5G    18K  /datab
# zfs create -p -o compression=on datab/users/area51</pre><p>If the intermediate dataset exists during the create operation, the operation completes successfully.</p><p>Properties specified apply to the target dataset, not to the intermediate datasets. For example:</p><pre># zfs get mountpoint,compression datab/users/area51
NAME                PROPERTY     VALUE                SOURCE
datab/users/area51  mountpoint   /datab/users/area51  default
datab/users/area51  compression  on                   local</pre><p>The intermediate dataset is created with the default mount point. Any additional properties are disabled for the intermediate dataset. For example:</p><pre># zfs get mountpoint,compression datab/users
NAME         PROPERTY     VALUE         SOURCE
datab/users  mountpoint   /datab/users  default
datab/users  compression  off           default</pre><p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zfs-1m?a=view"><tt>zfs</tt>(1M)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS hotplugging enhancements</b> &ndash; Starting with this release, ZFS more effectively responds to devices that are removed. ZFS also provides a mechanism to automatically identify devices that are inserted with the following enhancements:</p>
<ul><li><p>You can replace an existing device with an equivalent device without having to use the <tt>zpool replace</tt> command.</p><p>The <tt>autoreplace</tt> property controls automatic device replacement. If the property is set to off, device replacement must be initiated by the administrator by using the <tt>zpool replace</tt> command. If the property is set to on, any new device which is found in the same physical location as a device that previously belonged to the pool, is automatically formatted and replaced. The default value for the <tt>autoreplace</tt> property is off.</p></li>
<li><p>The storage pool state <tt>REMOVED</tt> is provided when a device or hot spare has been removed if the device was physically removed while the system was running. A hot-spare device is substituted for the removed device, if available.</p></li>
<li><p>If a device is removed and then inserted, the device is placed online. If a hot-spare was activated when the device is re-inserted, the spare is removed when the online operation completes.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic detection when devices are removed or inserted is hardware-dependent and might not be supported on all platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Hot spares are checked periodically to make sure they are online and available.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zpool-1m?a=view"><tt>zpool</tt>(1M)</a>.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information about these ZFS file system enhancements, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271"><i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gfrbb"></a><h4><tt>uid_t</tt> and <tt>gid_t</tt> Type Changes</h4>
<p>This developer tools enhancement is new in the Developer 9/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the <tt>uid_t</tt> and <tt>gid_t</tt> types have been changed
from <tt>long</tt> (32-bit binaries) and <tt>int</tt> (64-bit binaries) types to the <tt>uint32_t</tt> type. This
type is used for both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries. This change promotes compatibility
with other operating systems.</p><p>As part of changing the type of <tt>uid_t</tt> and <tt>gid_t</tt>, the Solaris
implementation also reserves the <tt>uid_t</tt> and <tt>gid_t</tt> values that range from 231
to 232 - 2. The value 232 - 1 continues to be reserved
for use as a sentinel value. Values that are assigned in this new
range are temporary assignments made by the new identity mapping service. Note that,
these values do not persist over a system reboot. Therefore, applications should not
write UID or GID values to persistent files in the file system. Nor
should applications send these values across a network connection as a means of
referring to a persistent identity. For persistence, use the corresponding identity name. Solaris
utilities, such as the <tt>tar</tt> command, and the NFSv4 network protocol, already follow
these best practices.</p><p>Because the new and old <tt>uid_t</tt> and <tt>gid_t</tt> types occupy the same amount
of space, existing binaries are not affected. For example, binaries that are compiled
with older definitions. In these instances, there is no need to recompile the
code. Binaries, object files, as well as shared libraries including libraries that are
linked against Solaris shared libraries, are also not affected.</p><p>The impact of these changes are as following:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>For Newly-compiled C binaries</b> &ndash; When code is recompiled, standard development practices should catch any problems that are caused by changes in the <tt>uid_t</tt> and <tt>gid_t</tt> type. In cases where the change of sign might have implications for the semantics of the code, the C compiler and, or, the lint process produce certain warnings. Developers should note that any warnings generated as a result of this change should be inspected.</p></li>
<li><p><b>For C++ code</b> &ndash; As part of the function's symbol name, C++ compilers employ a technique that is called &ldquo;name mangling&rdquo;. This technique encodes the primitive type names that are used in function call signatures. The change in the <tt>uid_t</tt> and <tt>gid_t</tt> type results in different name mangling for C++ functions and objects.</p><p>As with C binaries, C++ binaries and libraries continue to function as before. The exception is when libraries contain interfaces that use <tt>uid_t</tt> and <tt>gid_t</tt>.</p><p>The Solaris OS does not expose C++ interfaces of this nature. Therefore, no incompatibilities with Solaris libraries are expected.</p><p>For details on the consequences of this change, including warnings, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-0543/gfraf?a=view">Changes to uid_t and gid_t Types in the Developer 9/07 Release in <i>Solaris Express Developer Edition Release Notes</i></a>.</p></li></ul>


<a name="gfoxs"></a><h4>Locale Creator</h4>
<p>This language support enhancement is new in the Developer 9/07 release.</p><p>Locale Creator is a command line and Graphical User Interface tool which enables
users to create and customize Solaris locales. This tool enables users to create
installable Solaris packages containing customized locale data of a specific locale. Once the
created package has been installed, the user has a fully working locale available
on the system. For more information, see:</p>
<ul><li><p>Run the command <tt>/usr/bin/localectr <tt>-h</tt></tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>localectr</tt> man page</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://developers.sun.com/global/products_platforms/solaris/reference/techart/locale-creator.html">http://developers.sun.com/global/products_platforms/solaris/reference/techart/locale-creator.html</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="ggdqv"></a><h4>x86: MONITOR and MWAIT CPU Idle Loop</h4>
<p>This kernel functions enhancement is new in the Developer 9/07 release.</p><p>The Solaris OS uses the SSE3 MONITOR and MWAIT instructions in x86
processor idle loop. Using the SSE3 instructions in the processor idle loop eliminates the
overhead of sending and receiving an interrupt to wake up a halted
processor. MONITOR is used to specify a memory range to &ldquo;monitor&rdquo;. MWAIT halts the
processor until the address previously specified with MONITOR is accessed. With the new
idle loop a processor only has to write to memory to wake up
a halted processor.</p>

<a name="gfrav"></a><h4>IPsec and IKE Are Managed as SMF Services</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Developer 9/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the service management facility (SMF) manages IPsec and IKE
as a set of services:</p>
<ul><li><p>svc:/network/ipsec/policy:default</p></li>
<li><p>svc:/network/ipsec/ipsecalgs:default</p></li>
<li><p>svc:/network/ipsec/manual-key:default</p></li>
<li><p>svc:/network/ipsec/ike:default</p></li></ul>
<p>By default, the policy and ipsecalgs services are enabled, and the manual-key and
ike services are disabled. For traffic to be protected by IPsec, configure either
manual keying or IKE, and populate the <tt>/etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf</tt> file. This enables the appropriate
key management service before refreshing the policy service. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-3000/ipsec-ov-1?a=view">Chapter 19, IP Security Architecture (Overview), in <i>System Administration Guide: IP Services</i></a>.</p><p>The Network IPsec Management profile is added for managing IPsec in a role.

<a name="ggdns"></a><h4>iSNS Support in the Solaris iSCSI Target</h4>
<p>This device management enhancement is new in the Developer 9/07 release.</p><p>This Solaris release provides support for the Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol
in the Solaris iSCSI target software. The iSNS protocol enables automated discovery, management,
and configuration of iSCSI devices on a TCP/IP network.</p><p>Currently, the Solaris iSCSI software does not include native iSNS server support, but
in this Solaris release, you can use the <tt>iscsitadm</tt> command to add access
to an existing iSNS server to automatically discover the iSCSI devices in your
network. The iSNS server can be specified by hostname or IP address. After
you add the iSNS server information, you will need to enable access to
the server.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/iscsitadm-1m?a=view"><tt>iscsitadm</tt>(1M)</a> and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2723/fmvcd?a=view">Chapter 14, Configuring Solaris iSCSI Targets and Initiators (Tasks), in <i>System Administration Guide: Devices and File Systems</i></a>.</p>

<a name="gfrce"></a><h4>SPARC: Shared Contexts Support</h4>
<p>This system performance enhancement is new in the Developer 9/07 release.</p><p>The context mechanism, which is used by the Memory Management Unit (MMU) hardware
to distinguish between the use of the same virtual address in different process
address spaces, introduces some inefficiencies when shared memory is used. The inefficiencies are
because the data at a particular shared memory the address in different processes
may really be identical, but the context number associated with each process is
different. Therefore, the MMU hardware will not be able to recognize a match.
This results in mappings being unnecessarily evicted from the MMU translation cache, Translation
Lookaside Buffer (TLB), to be replaced by identical mappings with a different context
number.</p><p>The UltraSPARC T2 (Niagara 2) system has an additional &ldquo;shared&rdquo; context, which is
a hardware feature which can be used to prevent the inefficiency in handling
shared memory. When the TLB is searched for mapping a match on either
the private or the shared context results in a TLB hit. The
current software support for shared context activates the feature for processes which use Dynamic
Intimate Shared Memory (DISM). In this case the process text segment and DISM
segments mapped at the same virtual address and with the same permissions for
each process will use the shared context.</p>

<a name="ggetk"></a><h4>The <tt>audit_user</tt>(4) Database Is Not Access-restricted</h4>
<p>This security enhancement is new in the Developer 9/07 release.</p><p>The <tt>audit_user</tt>(4) database is no longer an access-restricted database. Existing Network Information Service
Plus (NIS+) name servers can be updated with the command:</p><pre># nischmod nw+r audit_user</pre><p>Ensure the following conditions:</p>
<ul><li><p>The SolarisAuditUser object class entries should be publicly readable. Existing LDAP directory name servers should not modify the SolarisAuditUser object class entries, SolarisAuditAlways and SolarisAuditNever acis, from the default, <tt>idsconfig</tt>(1M).</p></li>
<li><p>If the <tt>/usr/lib/ldap/idsconfig</tt> file has customized acis for the SolarisAuditAlways and SolarisAuditNever object class entries, the customized acis should allow anonymous read access.</p></li></ul>
<p>Creating a new NIS name server using the installed <tt>ypmake</tt>(1M) creates an unrestricted
<tt>audit_user</tt> database.  Similarly, creating a new NIS+ name server using <tt>nissetup</tt>(1M) also creates
an unrestricted <tt>audit_user</tt> database.</p><p>For more information, see the following:</p>
