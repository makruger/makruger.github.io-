<a name="geyxk"></a><h3>New Features in Solaris Express Developer Edition 5/07</h3>


<a name="geyyv"></a><h4>Quagga Software Routing Suite</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>Quagga Software Routing Suite delivers a set of IETF routing protocols for Solaris,
including OSPF and BGP, allowing for high-availability deployment of Solaris through dynamic routing,
manageable through SMF 'routeadm'.</p><p>Quagga is a community fork of the GNU Zebra software previously included in
Solaris, providing many updates and some new features. For more information, see <tt>/etc/quagga/README.Solaris</tt>.</p>

<a name="geyyw"></a><h4>DHCPv6 Client</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the Solaris OS supports Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
IPv6 (DHCPv6), as described in RFC 3315. DHCPv6 enables Solaris to acquire IPv6
addresses automatically from the local DHCP servers without manual configuration.</p><p>For more information, see the following man pages:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/dhcpagent-1m?a=view"><tt>dhcpagent</tt>(1M)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/in.ndpd-1m?a=view"><tt>in.ndpd</tt>(1M)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/ifconfig-1m?a=view"><tt>ifconfig</tt>(1M)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2251/ndpd.conf-4?a=view"><tt>ndpd.conf</tt>(4)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2239/dhcpinfo-1?a=view"><tt>dhcpinfo</tt>(1)</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="geyxs"></a><h4><tt>nwamd</tt> Network Auto-Configuration Daemon</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The Developer 5/07 release booting process runs the <tt>nwamd</tt> daemon. This daemon implements
an alternate instance of the SMF service, <tt>svc:/network/physical</tt>, which enables automated network
configuration with minimal intervention.</p><p>The <tt>nwamd</tt> daemon monitors the Ethernet port and automatically enables DHCP on the
appropriate IP interface. If no cable is plugged into a wired network, the
<tt>nwamd</tt> daemon conducts a wireless scan and sends queries to the user for
a WiFi access point to connect to.</p><p>Laptop users do not need to spend extensive amounts of time manually configuring
the interfaces on their systems. Automatic configuration also aids system administrators, who can
reconfigure network addresses with minimal intervention.</p><p>The OpenSolaris Network Auto-Magic Phase 0 page and <tt>nwamd</tt> man page contain further
details, including instructions for turning off the <tt>nwamd</tt> daemon, if preferred. For
more information and a link to the <tt>nwamd</tt>(1M) man page, see <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/nwam/phase0/">http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/nwam/phase0/</a>.</p>

<a name="geyya"></a><h4>Sendmail</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>There are some minor new options to <tt>sendmail</tt>(1M) and some new configuration macros
described in <tt>/etc/mail/cf/README</tt>. The chief of these macros are the following three new
FEATURE() macros, all of which are helpful in blocking unwanted spam:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>badmx</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>require_rdns</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>block_bad_helo</tt></p></li></ul>
<p>For information about <tt>sendmail</tt>, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/sendmail-1m?a=view"><tt>sendmail</tt>(1M)</a> man page.</p>

<a name="geyye"></a><h4>x86: Wireless WPA Supplicant</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The Solaris WiFi driver has been enhanced to support WiFi Protected Access (WPA)
personal mode. Starting with this release, a new service, <tt>network/wpa</tt>, is introduced.
The <tt>nwam</tt>(1M), <tt>dladm</tt>(1M), <tt>net80211</tt>(5), and <tt>ath</tt>(7D) drivers are enhanced to support the WPA
personal mode. Users can access the WPA wireless network by using <tt>dladm</tt> or
<tt>nwam</tt>:</p><pre>$ dladm create-secobj -c wpa mykey  /* create a wpa psk specified by your AP */</pre><pre>$ dladm connect-wifi -e essid -k mykey</pre>

<a name="geyyn"></a><h4>x86: <tt>nge</tt> Driver Updated to Support Jumbo Framework</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the <tt>nge</tt> driver has been updated to enable Jumbo
Frame support. The <tt>nge</tt> driver's default MTU has been raised to 9 Kbytes,
that improves system performance and lowers CPU utilization significantly.</p><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2254/nge-7d?a=view"><tt>nge</tt>(7D)</a> man page.</p>

<a name="ggetv"></a><h4>Sockets Direct Protocol</h4>
<p>This networking enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP) is a transport protocol layered over the Infiniband
Transport Framework (IBTF). SDP is a standard implementation based on Annex 4 of
the Infiniband Architecture Specification Vol1. SDP provides reliable byte-stream, flow controlled, two-way data
transmission which is very similar to TCP.</p><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2254/sdp-7d?a=view"><tt>sdp</tt>(7D)</a> man page.</p>

<a name="geyzz"></a><h4>PPD File Management Utility</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file management utility, <tt>/usr/sbin/ppdmgr</tt>, manages PPD files that are
used with the Solaris print subsystem.</p><p>By using the <tt>ppdmgr</tt> utility, you can perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul><li><p>Add a PPD file to a PPD file repository on a system</p></li>
<li><p>Supply a label to group PPD files within a PPD file repository</p></li>
<li><p>Update the cache of the PPD file information that is used by the Solaris Print Manager (<tt>printmgr</tt>) GUI to display supported printer information</p></li></ul>
<p>You can add a new PPD file by using the <tt>ppdmgr</tt> utility or
by using the <tt>lpadmin <tt>-n</tt></tt> command. When you add a new PPD file, you
automatically update the cache of the PPD file information that the <tt>printmgr</tt> GUI
uses to display supported printer information.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The delivery location of PPD files in the Solaris OS has changed. During
a software upgrade, any print servers with print queues that were defined by
using PPD files from the previous PPD file delivery location, are automatically updated
to reflect the new PPD file delivery location.</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, a new SMF service, print/ppd-cache-update, has been introduced. This service runs
one time during system reboot to update the printer cache information with changes
from all the PPD file repositories on the system. The service might take
longer to transition to an online state during a system reboot after a
software installation or upgrade. Also, if any changes were made to the PPD
file repositories since the last PPD cache update, during system reboot, the service
might take longer to come online. Changes made to the PPD file repositories
on a system are not reflected in the PPD cache used by Solaris
Print Manager until the print/ppd-cache-update service is online. The print/ppd-cache-update service is enabled
by default.</p><p>For more information, see the following:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/ppdmgr-1m?a=view"><tt>ppdmgr</tt>(1M)</a> man page</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-7761/ppdadmin-1?a=view">Chapter 9, Administering Printers by Using the PPD File Management Utility (Tasks), in <i>System Administration Guide: Solaris Printing</i></a></p></li></ul>


<a name="geyzh"></a><h4><tt>raidctl</tt></h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p><tt>raidctl</tt> is a utility that can perform RAID configuration work by using multiple
RAID controllers. The <tt>raidctl</tt> feature contains more detailed information about RAID components, including
controller, volume and physical disks. The <tt>raidctl</tt> utility enables the user to track the
RAID system more closely and simplify the learning effort on diverse RAID controllers.</p><p>For more information, see:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/raidctl-1m?a=view"><tt>raidctl</tt>(1M)</a> man page</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.lsi.com/storage_home/products_home/host_bus_adapters/index.html">http://www.lsi.com/storage_home/products_home/host_bus_adapters/index.html</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="geyzn"></a><h4>x86: <tt>stmsboot</tt> Porting</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the <tt>stmsboot</tt> utility is ported to x86 systems. <tt>stmsboot</tt>
is a utility that  is used to enable or disable MPxIO for
fibre-channel devices. This <tt>stmsboot</tt> utility already exists on SPARC systems.</p><p>Users can use this utility to enable or disable MPxIO automatically. Previously, users
had to enable or disable MPxIO manually, which was difficult, especially for a
SAN system boot.</p><p>For more information, see the following:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/stmsboot-1m?a=view"><tt>stmsboot</tt>(1M)</a> man page</p></li>
<li><p>Section about Enabling or Disabling Multipathing on x86 Based Systems in <i>Solaris Fibre Channel Storage Configuration and Multipathing Support Guide</i> at <a href="http://docs.sun.com">http://docs.sun.com</a>.</p></li></ul>


<a name="geyzk"></a><h4>MPxIO Path Steering</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The MPxIO path steering feature includes a mechanism for issuing SCSI commands to
an MPxIO LU to be delivered down a specified path to the
LU. In order to provide this functionality, a new <tt>IOCTL</tt> command, <tt>MP_SEND_SCSI_CMD</tt>, is
added and is referenced through the existing <tt>scsi_vhci IOCTL</tt> interface. An extension is
introduced to the multipath management library (MP-API) which provides access to this new
<tt>IOCTL</tt> command. This allows network administrators to run diagnostic commands through a specified path.</p>

<a name="geyzg"></a><h4>x86: GRUB Extended Support for Directly Loading and Booting the <tt>unix</tt> Kernel</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, changes have been made to GRUB that enable the
boot loader to directly load and boot the <tt>unix</tt> kernel. The GRUB <tt>multiboot</tt>
module is no longer used. This implementation integrates the previous multiboot functionality directly
into the platform-specific <tt>unix</tt> kernel module. These changes reduce the time, as
well as memory requirements, that are needed to boot the Solaris OS.</p><p>Other additions and modifications to GRUB based booting include:</p>
<ul><li><p>The addition of two new keywords, <tt>kernel$</tt> and <tt>module$</tt>.</p><p>These keywords assist in the creation of <tt>menu.lst</tt> file entries that work with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>bootadm</tt> command has also been modified to create GRUB <tt>menu.lst</tt> file entries that contain the platform-specific <tt>unix</tt> module, which is now loaded directly by GRUB.</p><p>During a software upgrade, the <tt>bootadm</tt> command converts any multiboot entries in the <tt>menu.lst</tt> file to directly refer to the <tt>unix</tt> kernel module. For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/boot-1m?a=view"><tt>boot</tt>(1M)</a> and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/bootadm-1m?a=view"><tt>bootadm</tt>(1M)</a> man pages. </p><p>For step-by-step instructions, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2379/grubtasks-1?a=view">Chapter 11, Administering the GRUB Bootloader (Tasks), in <i>System Administration Guide: Basic Administration</i></a> and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2379/hbx86boot-68676?a=view">Chapter 12, Booting a Solaris System With GRUB (Tasks), in <i>System Administration Guide: Basic Administration</i></a>.</p></li></ul>


<a name="geyzs"></a><h4>SunVTS 7.0</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>SunVTS<sup>TM</sup> is a comprehensive system validation and test suite designed to support Sun
hardware platforms and peripherals. SunVTS 7.0 is the next generation of SunVTS 6.0
and its compatible versions.</p><p>SunVTS 7.0 includes the following features:</p>
<ul><li><p>Introduction of the concept of purpose-based testing</p></li>
<li><p>Improved diagnostics effectiveness</p></li>
<li><p>Web-based user interface</p></li>
<li><p>Simplified usage</p></li>

<a name="geyzj"></a><h4>DTrace Enabled Control Block <tt>dcmd</tt></h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, the <tt>::dtrace_ecb dcmd</tt> to the modular debugger, <tt>mdb</tt>, enables a
user to iterate over the Enabled Control Blocks (ECBs) for a given DTrace
user. This feature enables easy access to the data structures related to a
user's currently enabled probes.</p>

<a name="gezaw"></a><h4> Brand-Specific Handlers for <tt>zoneadm</tt> Commands</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The <tt>zoneadm</tt>(1M) command is modified to call an external program that performs validation
checks against a specific <tt>zoneadm</tt> operation on a branded zone. The checks are
performed before the specified <tt>zoneadm</tt> subcommand is executed. However, the external brand-specific
handler program for <tt>zoneadm</tt>(1M) should be specified by the brand's configuration file, <tt>/usr/lib/brand/&lt;brand_name>/config.xml</tt>. The external
program is specified by the brand's configuration file by using the <tt>&lt;verify_adm></tt> tag.</p><p>To introduce a new type of branded zone, and list brand-specific handlers for
the <tt>zoneadm</tt>(1M) subcommand, add the following line to the brand's <tt>config.xml</tt> file:</p><pre>&lt;verify_adm>&lt;absolute path to external program> %z %* %*&lt;/verify_adm></pre><p>In this line, <tt>%z</tt> is the zone name, the first <tt>%*</tt>is the
<tt>zoneadm</tt> subcommand, and the second <tt>%*</tt> is the subcommand's arguments.</p><p>This feature is useful when a given branded zone might not support
all the <tt>zoneadm</tt>(1M) operations possible. Brand-specific handlers provide a way to gracefully fail unsupported
<tt>zoneadm</tt> commands.</p><p>Ensure that the handler program that you specify recognizes all <tt>zoneadm</tt>(1M) subcommands.</p>

<a name="geyzq"></a><h4>x86: SATA AHCI HBA Driver</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The AHCI driver is a SATA framework-compliant HBA driver that supports various SATA
HBA controllers that are compatible with the AHCI specification defined by Intel. Currently,
the AHCI driver supports INTEL ICH6 and VIA vt8251 controllers, and hot-plugging functions.</p><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2254/ahci-7d?a=view"><tt>ahci</tt>(7D)</a> man page.</p>

<a name="geyzf"></a><h4>x86: Firmware Download Capability for SATA Drives</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>This feature provides firmware download capability for SATA drives under the SATA framework.
System administrators can use the USCSI interface to update firmware on SATA disks.</p>

<a name="geyzr"></a><h4>x86: SCSI LOG SENSE Support Under SATA Module </h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The SCSI LOG SENSE support feature provides the capability of obtaining the following
information:</p><dl><dt>SCSI LOG SENSE PAGES 0</dt>
<dd><p>The available pages</p></dd>
<dt><tt>0x10</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Self test results</p></dd>
<dt><tt>0x2f</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Information Exception log</p></dd>
<dt><tt>0x30</tt></dt>
<dd><p>SMART READ DATA</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="geyzm"></a><h4>x86: Informational Exception Control Page</h4>
<p>This system administration enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>The SATA framework now supports the Informational Exception Control page. The Informational Exception
Control page enables and disables Informational Exception reporting, which is necessary for device-health
monitoring.</p>

<a name="geyzy"></a><h4>IP Instances: LAN and VLAN Separation for Non-Global Zones</h4>
<p>This system resources enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>IP networking can now be configured in two different ways, depending on whether
the zone is assigned an exclusive IP instance or shares the IP layer
configuration and state with the global zone. IP types are configured by using
the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command.</p><p>The shared-IP type is the default. These zones connect to the same
 VLANs or same LANs as the global zone and share the IP
layer. <tt>lx</tt> branded zones are configured as Shared-IP zones. For more information, see
<a href="gdyuj.html#gdyvl">x86: <tt>lx</tt> Branded Zones: Solaris Containers for Linux Applications</a>.</p><p>Full IP-level functionality is available in an exclusive-IP zone. If a  zone
must be isolated at the IP layer on the network, then the
zone  can have an exclusive IP. The exclusive-IP zone can be used
to  consolidate applications that must communicate on different subnets  that are
on different VLANs or different LANs.</p><p>For more information, see the following:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/zonecfg-1m?a=view"><tt>zonecfg</tt>(1M)</a> man page</p></li>

<a name="geyzl"></a><h4>Improved <tt>zonecfg</tt> Procedures for Creating Containers</h4>
<p>This system resources enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>More integrated resource management and zones features now make it easier to leverage
the resource-management capabilities of  the system through the <tt>zonecfg</tt> command. The
resource configuration you specify is automatically created for you when the zone boots.
You no longer have to perform any manual steps related to setting up
resource management.</p>
<ul><li><p>The <tt>zonecfg</tt> command can be used to configure resource management settings for the global zone.</p></li>
<li><p>Zone-wide resource controls can be set by using global property names, the preferred method.</p></li>
<li><p>The new <tt>zone.max-swap</tt> control provides swap capping for zones through the capped-memory resource.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional methods for setting the default scheduler in a zone, including a new scheduling-class property, have been added.</p></li>
<li><p>Resource pools have been enhanced. You can add a temporary pool that is created dynamically when a zone boots. The pool is configured  through the <tt>dedicated-cpu</tt> resource.</p></li>
<li><p>A <tt>clear</tt> subcommand is available to clear the value for optional settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced physical memory capping from the global zone is available through improvements to <tt>rcapd</tt>(1M). Limits are configured through the capped-memory resource.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>This capability can be used to cap physical memory for lx branded zones and native zones. See <a href="gdyuj.html#gdyvl">x86: <tt>lx</tt> Branded Zones: Solaris Containers for Linux Applications</a>.</p>
<hr>
</li>

<a name="ggdpx"></a><h4>New <tt>projmod</tt>(1M) Option </h4>
<p>This system resources enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>Use the <tt>projmod</tt> command with the <tt>-A</tt> option to apply the resource control
values found in the project database to the active project. Existing values that
do not match the values defined in the project file, such as values
set manually by <tt>prctl</tt>(1), are removed.</p>

<a name="geyzw"></a><h4>Solaris ZFS File System Enhancements</h4>
<p>This section describes new ZFS features in the Solaris Express Developer Edition 5/07
release.</p>
<ul><li><p><b>Recursively renaming ZFS snapshots</b> &ndash; You can recursively rename all descendant ZFS snapshots by using the <tt>zfs rename</tt> <tt>-r</tt> command. </p><p>For example, snapshot a set of ZFS file systems called <tt>users/home@today</tt>. Then, rename all the snapshots in one command the next day, as <tt>users/home/@yesterday</tt>.</p><p>Snapshots are the only dataset that can be renamed recursively. </p></li>
<li><p><b>GZIP compression is available</b> &ndash; You can set <tt>gzip</tt> compression on ZFS file systems in addition to <tt>lzjb</tt> compression. You can specify compression as <tt>gzip</tt>, the default, or <tt>gzip-</tt><i>N</i>, where <i>N</i> equals 1 through 9. For example:</p><pre># zfs create -o compression=gzip users/home/snapshots
# zfs get compression users/home/snapshots
NAME                  PROPERTY     VALUE            SOURCE
users/home/snapshots  compression  gzip             local
# zfs create -o compression=gzip-9 users/home/oldfiles
# zfs get compression users/home/oldfiles
NAME                  PROPERTY     VALUE           SOURCE
users/home/oldfiles   compression  gzip-9          local</pre></li>
<li><p><b>Storing multiple copies of ZFS user data</b> &ndash; As a reliability feature, ZFS file system metadata is automatically stored multiple times across different disks, if possible. This feature is known as <b>ditto blocks</b>.</p><p>Starting with this release, you can specify that multiple copies of user data is also stored per file system by using the <tt>zfs set copies</tt> command. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs set copies=2 users/home</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs get copies users/home</b></tt>
NAME        PROPERTY  VALUE       SOURCE
users/home  copies    2           local</pre><p>Available values are 1, 2, or 3. The default value is 1. These copies are in addition to any pool-level redundancy, such as in a mirrored or RAID-Z configuration.</p><p>The benefits of storing multiple copies of ZFS user data are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><p>Improves data retention by allowing recovery from unrecoverable block read faults, such as media faults (bit rot) for all ZFS configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides data protection even in the case where only a single disk is available.</p></li>
<li><p>Allows you to select data protection policies on a per-file system basis, beyond the capabilities of the storage pool.</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Improved storage pool status information</b> (<tt>zpool status</tt>) &ndash; You can use the <tt>zpool status</tt> <tt>-v</tt> command to display a list of files with persistent errors. Previously, you had to use the <tt>find</tt> <tt>-inum</tt> command to identify the filenames from the list of displayed inodes.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sharing ZFS file system enhancements</b> &ndash; The process of sharing file systems has been improved. Although modifying system configuration files, such as <tt>/etc/dfs/dfstab</tt>, is unnecessary for sharing ZFS file systems, you can use the <tt>sharemgr</tt> command to manage ZFS share properties. The <tt>sharemgr</tt> command enables you to set and manage share properties on share groups. ZFS shares are automatically designated in the <tt>zfs</tt> share group.</p><p>As in previous releases, you can set the ZFS <tt>sharenfs</tt> property on a ZFS file system to share a ZFS file system. For example:</p><pre># zfs set sharenfs=on tank/home</pre><p>Or, you can use the new <tt>sharemgr</tt> <tt>add-share</tt> subcommand to share a ZFS file system in the <tt>zfs</tt> share group. For example:</p><pre># sharemgr add-share -s tank/data zfs
# sharemgr show -vp zfs
zfs nfs=()
     zfs/tank/data
           /tank/data
           /tank/data/1
           /tank/data/2
           /tank/data/3</pre><p>Then, you can use the <tt>sharemgr</tt> command to manage ZFS shares. The following example shows how to use <tt>sharemgr</tt> to set the <tt>nosuid</tt> property on the shared ZFS file systems. You must preface ZFS share paths with <tt>/zfs</tt> designation.</p><pre># sharemgr set -P nfs -p nosuid=true zfs/tank/data
# sharemgr show -vp zfs
zfs nfs=()
     zfs/tank/data nfs=(nosuid="true")
           /tank/data
           /tank/data/1
           /tank/data/2
           /tank/data/3</pre></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS and Solaris iSCSI improvements</b> &ndash; You can create a ZFS volume as a Solaris iSCSI target device by setting the <tt>shareiscsi</tt> property on the ZFS volume. This method is a convenient way to quickly set up a Solaris iSCSI target. For example:</p><pre># zfs create -V 2g tank/volumes/v2
# zfs set shareiscsi=on tank/volumes/v2
# iscsitadm list target
Target: tank/volumes/v2
     iSCSI Name: iqn.1986-03.com.sun:02:984fe301-c412-ccc1-cc80-cf9a72aa062a
     Connections: 0</pre><p>After the iSCSI target is created, set up the iSCSI initiator. For information about setting up a Solaris iSCSI initiator, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2723/fmvcd?a=view">Chapter 14, Configuring Solaris iSCSI Targets and Initiators (Tasks), in <i>System Administration Guide: Devices and File Systems</i></a>.</p><p>For more information about managing a ZFS volume as an iSCSI target, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/817-2271"><i>ZFS Administration Guide</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ZFS property improvements</b></p>
<ul><li><p>ZFS <tt>xattr</tt> property &ndash; You can use the <tt>xattr</tt> property to disable or enable extended attributes for a specific ZFS file system. The default value is on. </p></li>
<li><p>ZFS <tt>canmount</tt> property &ndash; You use the <tt>canmount</tt> property to specify whether a dataset can be mounted by using the <tt>zfs mount</tt> command. </p></li>
<li><p>ZFS user properties &ndash; ZFS supports user properties, in addition to the standard native properties that can either export internal statistics or control ZFS file system behavior. User properties have no effect on ZFS behavior, but you can use them to annotate datasets with information that is meaningful in your environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting properties when creating ZFS file systems &ndash; You can set properties when you create a file system, in addition to setting properties after the file system is created.</p><p>The following examples illustrate equivalent syntax:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs create tank/home</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs set mountpoint=/export/zfs tank/home</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs set sharenfs=on tank/home</b></tt>
# <tt><b>zfs set compression=on tank/home</b></tt></pre><pre># <tt><b>zfs create -o mountpoint=/export/zfs -o sharenfs=on -o compression=on tank/home</b></tt></pre></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Display all ZFS file system information</b> &ndash; You can use various forms of the <tt>zfs get</tt> command to display information about all datasets if you do not specify a dataset. In previous releases, all dataset information was not retrievable with the <tt>zfs get</tt> command. For example:</p><pre># <tt><b>zfs get -s local all</b></tt>
tank/home               atime          off                    local
tank/home/bonwick       atime          off                    local
tank/home/marks         quota          50G                    local</pre></li>
<li><p><b>New zfs receive -F option</b> &ndash;  You can use the new <tt>-F</tt> option to the <tt>zfs receive</tt> command to force a rollback of the file system to the most recent snapshot before doing the receive. Using this option might be necessary when the file system is modified between the time a rollback occurs and the receive is initiated.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Recursive ZFS snapshots</b> &ndash; Recursive snapshots are available. When you use the <tt>zfs snapshot</tt> command to create a file system snapshot, you can use the <tt>-r</tt> option to recursively create snapshots for all descendant file systems. In addition, using the <tt>-r</tt> option recursively destroys all descendant snapshots when a snapshot is destroyed.</p></li></ul>

<a name="gezcd"></a><h4>64-bit SPARC: CPU Power Management</h4>
<p>This device management enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>This feature introduces two new <tt>power.conf</tt> keywords to permit CPU devices to be
power managed independently of automatic power management. These are the new <tt>power.conf</tt> keywords:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>cpupm</tt></p><p>Usage:</p><pre>cpupm &lt;<b>behavior</b>></pre><p>Here, the behavior is <tt>enable</tt> or <tt>disable</tt>.</p><p>For backward compatibility, if the <tt>cpupm</tt> keyword is not present in the <tt>/etc/power.conf</tt> file, the CPUs are power managed if <tt>autopm</tt> is enabled, and not power managed if <tt>autopm</tt> is disabled. <tt>enable</tt> or <tt>disable</tt> are independent of the <tt>autopm</tt> setting.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>cpu-threshold</tt></p><p>Usage:</p><pre>cpu-threshold &lt;<b>threshold</b>></pre><p>This keyword enables the user to specify a threshold which will apply to any power-manageable CPU, independent of the system-threshold value.</p><p>If CPU power management is enabled, the power level of any CPU that is idle for the specified threshold time is reduced to the next lower level.</p><p>If <tt>cpu-threshold</tt> is absent, system threshold is used.</p><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2251/power.conf-4?a=view"><tt>power.conf</tt>(4)</a> man page.</p></li></ul>


<a name="gfany"></a><h4>Enhanced <tt>st</tt> SCSI Reservations</h4>
<p>This device management enhancement is new in the Developer 5/07 release.</p><p>Starting with this release, there is a new reservation mechanism in the <tt>st</tt>
driver. The new mechanism enables the <tt>st</tt> driver to reserve the tape drive
only when a command that requires reservations is sent. The reservation mechanism also
enables the <tt>st</tt> driver to process inquiry commands issued from other hosts while
the drive is reserved by a different host.</p><p>Some of Independent Software Vendor's (ISV's) backup software and media management tools benefit
from the enhanced <tt>st</tt> SCSI reservations feature. Because of this new feature, management
tools could inquire and browse tape libraries when the backup tool is reading
or writing tapes.</p>
