<a name="gfgzu"></a><h3>Introduction to Setting Up Printers</h3>
<p>A <b>print server</b> is a system on which a print queue is configured and
makes the printer available to other systems on the network. A <b>print client</b> is
a system that utilizes configured print queues. For more information, see <a href="printconcept-49.html">The Solaris Print Client-Server Process</a>.</p><p>Printers can also be divided into two categories, local and remote. A <b>local printer</b>
refers to a print queue that has been defined on a system that
is local to you. A remote printer refers to a print queue that
is defined anywhere <b>but</b> your local system. These terms do not have anything
to do with whether the printer is physically attached to a system or
to the network, but rather where the print queue was configured. Where the
print queue is configured determines the server for that printer. Often, the print
server supporting a building full of printers is the same system.</p><p>Another way to view printers and printer setup is how they are
connected to the world. Some printers are directly attached to the print server
by a wire. These printers are referred to as attached printers. If a
printer is attached to the network, rather than to a desktop or server,
it is called a network printer. The terms <b>local</b> and <b>remote</b> refer to print
queue configuration. The terms <b>directly attached</b> and <b>network&hyphen;attached</b> refer to the physical connection
of the printer hardware. Referring to a printer as an attached or a
network printer defines the way the printer is physically connected. When you are
referring to a local or a remote printer, you are referring to how
the print queue for that printer was defined.  Sometimes, the use of
these terms can be confusing, because a printer that is physically attached to
a system also most likely has a print queue that was defined on
a local system. Similarly, print queues for network printers are more than likely
defined on a system that is remote to your local system. This is
the reason that attached and network printers are often referred to as local
and remote printers.</p>
