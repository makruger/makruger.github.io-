<a name="gdtfs"></a><h3>Introduction to Administering Printers</h3>
<p>After you set up print servers and print clients, you might need
to perform these administration tasks frequently:</p>
<ul><li><p>Delete a printer</p></li>
<li><p>Delete remote printer access</p></li>
<li><p>Check the status of printers</p></li>
<li><p>Restart the print scheduler</p></li></ul>


<a name="gfkjn"></a><h4>Administering Local Printers</h4>
<p>A local printer is a printer that has a print queue that
has been defined on a system that is local to you. A remote
printer is a printer that has a print queue that is defined anywhere
<b>but</b> your local system. These terms do not have anything to do with
whether the printer is physically attached to a system or to the network.
The terms strictly define where the print queue was configured, which is important
to note because where the print queue is configured determines the print server
for that printer. One print server can support all the printers at a
particular site.</p>

<a name="gfhak"></a><h4>Administering Network Printers</h4>
<p>A <b>network&hyphen;attached</b> printer is a hardware device that is connected directly to the
network. A network printer transfers data directly over the network to the output
device. The printer or network connection hardware has its own system name and
IP address.</p><p>Network printers often have software support provided by the printer vendor. If your
printer has printer vendor-supplied software, then use the printer vendor software. If the
network printer vendor does not provide software support, Sun supplied software is available.
This software provides generic support for network-attached printers. However, this software is not
capable of providing full access to all possible printer capabilities.</p><p>The terms &ldquo;attached&rdquo; and &ldquo;network&rdquo; refer to the way printers are connected to
the world. Neither of these terms imply local or remote.  Sometimes, these
terms are used interchangeably, due to the fact that local printers and attached
printers tend to be the same. However, the terms local and remote refer
to print queue configuration. The terms, attached and network, refer to the physical
connection of the printer hardware only, not how the print queue was configured.</p><p>For information about setting up a directly attached and network printers, see <a href="gfgxy.html">Setting Up Printers on a Print Server (Task Map)</a>.</p><p>For information about using over-the-wire network printing protocols for printing on the network,
see <a href="gedcr.html">Using Printing Protocols in the Solaris Release</a>.</p>

<a name="printref-40"></a><h5>Scheduling Network Print Requests</h5>
<a name="printref-ix201"></a><p>Each print client communicates directly with a print sever over the network. The
communication is done between the requesting command, such as <tt>lp</tt>, <tt>lpstat</tt>, <tt>cancel</tt>,
<tt>lpr</tt>, <tt>lpq</tt>, or <tt>lprm</tt>, and the print service on the print server. This
communication reduces the print system overhead on client&ndash;only systems, improving scalability, performance and
accuracy of data.</p><p>Print servers listen for print requests with the Internet services daemon (<tt>inetd</tt>). Upon
hearing a request for print service from the network, the <tt>inetd</tt> daemon starts
a program called the <b>protocol adaptor</b> (<tt>in.lpd</tt>). The protocol adaptor translates the print request
and communicates it to the print spooler, and returns the results to the
requester. This protocol adaptor starts on demand and exits when it has serviced
the network request. This process eliminates idle system overhead for printing. This process
also eliminates any additional system configuration for network printing support as was the
case in previous versions of Solaris printing software.</p>

<a name="gdthb"></a><h4>Setting Definitions for Printers</h4>
<a name="indexterm-70"></a><a name="indexterm-71"></a><p>Setting definitions for the printers on your network is an ongoing task that
lets you provide a more effective print environment for users. For example, you
can assign printer descriptions for all your site's printers to help users find
where a printer is located. Or, you can define a class of
printers to provide the fastest turnaround for print requests. </p><p>For information on setting up printer definitions and planning printers on your network,
see <a href="printplan-1.html">Chapter&nbsp;2, Planning for Printing in the Solaris Operating System (Tasks)</a>.</p>

<a name="erfaz"></a><h4>Administering Printers That Use PPD Files</h4>
<a name="indexterm-72"></a><a name="indexterm-73"></a><a name="indexterm-74"></a><p>Specific modifications have been made to incorporate the RIP feature and PPD files
into the Solaris print subsystem. Two interface scripts, <tt>standard_foomatic</tt>, and <tt>netstandard_foomatic</tt>, are
available. These interface scripts provide the generic Solaris interface between the Solaris spooler and
the back-end process of the Solaris print server.</p><p>For more information, see<a href="gfjno.html">Administering Printers That Are Associated With PPD Files (Task Map)</a> and <a href="ppdref-1.html">Using PPD Files To Set Up Printers</a>.</p>

<a name="gdtgk"></a><h4>Administering Character Sets, Filters, Forms, and Fonts</h4>
<p>Depending on your site's requirements and the types of printers you have on
the network, you might have to set up and administer printer-specific features of
the LP print service. For example, you can assign different print wheels, filters,
and forms to different printers. For background information and step-by-step instructions on how
to set up character sets, print filters, forms, and fonts, see <a href="printcust-66310.html">Chapter&nbsp;7, Customizing Printing Services and Printers (Tasks)</a>.</p>
