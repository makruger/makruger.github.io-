<a name="txsecuritypolicy"></a><h3>Trusted Extensions Security Policy</h3>
<p>Sensitivity labels control access to data and maintain the classification of data.
All processes and objects have a sensitivity label that is used in
MAC decisions. The labels are attributes that are interpreted by the system
security policy. The <b>system security policy</b> is the set of rules that is enforced
by system software to protect information being processed on the system.</p><p>The following sections describe how the Trusted Extensions security policy affects multilevel
operations, zones, and labels.</p>

<a name="api-intro-7"></a><h4>Multilevel Operations</h4>
<a name="indexterm-63"></a><a name="indexterm-64"></a><a name="indexterm-65"></a><a name="indexterm-66"></a><p>When you create an operation that runs at multiple security levels, you
must consider the following issues:</p>
<ul><li><p>Write-down policy in the global zone</p></li>
<li><p>Default security attributes</p></li>
<li><p>Default network policy</p></li>
<li><p>Multilevel ports</p></li>
<li><p>MAC-exempt sockets</p></li></ul>
<p>Operations that run at multiple security levels are controlled by the global
zone because only processes in the global zone can initiate processes at
specified labels.</p>

<a name="api-intro-12"></a><h5>Write-Down Policy in the Global Zone</h5>
<a name="indexterm-67"></a><a name="indexterm-68"></a><a name="indexterm-69"></a><a name="indexterm-70"></a><a name="indexterm-71"></a><a name="indexterm-72"></a><p>The ability of a subject, such as a process, to write an
object whose label it dominates is referred to as <b>writing down</b>. The write-down
policy in the global zone is specified administratively. Because global zone processes
run at the <tt>ADMIN_HIGH</tt> label, certain file systems that are associated with
other labels can be mounted read-write in the global zone. However, these
special file system mounts must be administratively specified in automount maps, and
they must be mounted by the global zone automounter. These mounts must
have mount points within the zone path of the zone that has
the same label as the exported file system. However, these mount points
must not be visible from within the labeled zone.</p><p>For example, if the <tt>PUBLIC</tt> zone has a zone path of <tt>/zone/public</tt>,
a writable mount point of <tt>/zone/public/home/mydir</tt> is permitted. However, a writable mount
point of <tt>/zone/public/root/home/mydir</tt> is not permitted because it can be accessed by
the labeled zone and <b>not</b> by the global zone. No cross-zone NFS
mounts are permitted, which means that the NFS-mounted files can only be
accessed by processes that run in the zone that mounted the file
system. Global zone processes can write down to such files, subject to
the standard discretionary access control (DAC) policy.</p><p>Local file systems associated with zones are protected from access by global
zone processes by DAC, which uses file <b>permissions</b> and access control lists
(ACLs). The parent directory of each zone's root (<tt>/</tt>) directory is only
accessible by <tt>root</tt> processes or by processes that assert the <tt>file_dac_search</tt> privilege.</p><p>In general, the ability to write down from the global zone is
restricted. Typically, writing down is used only when a file is reclassified
by using the <tt>setflabel()</tt> interface or when privileged users drag and drop
files between File Manager applications in different zones.</p>

<a name="gbeun"></a><h5>Default Security Attributes</h5>
<p>Default security attributes are assigned to messages that arrive on Trusted Extensions
hosts from other <b>host types</b>. The attributes are assigned according to settings in
the network database files. For information about host types, their supported security
attributes, and network database file defaults, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-7309"><i>Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator&rsquo;s Procedures</i></a>.</p>

<a name="api-intro-8"></a><h5>Default Network Policy</h5>
<a name="indexterm-73"></a><a name="indexterm-74"></a><p>For network operations that send or receive data, the default policy is
that the local process and the remote peer must have the same
label. This policy applies to all zones, including the global zone, whose
network label is <tt>ADMIN_LOW</tt>. However, the default network policy is more flexible
than the policy for mounting file systems. Trusted Extensions provides administrative interfaces
and programmatic interfaces for overriding the default network policy. For example, a
system administrator can create an MLP in the global zone or in
a labeled zone to enable listening at different labels.</p>

<a name="api-intro-9"></a><h5>Multilevel Ports</h5>
<a name="indexterm-75"></a><a name="indexterm-76"></a><a name="indexterm-77"></a><a name="indexterm-78"></a>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>Use extreme caution when using a multilevel port to violate MAC policy.
When you must use this mechanism, ensure that your server application enforces
MAC policy.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="indexterm-79"></a>Multilevel ports (MLPs) are listed in the <tt>tnzonecfg</tt> administrative database. Processes within
the zone can bind to MLPs if these processes assert the <tt>net_bindmlp</tt>
privilege. If the port number is less than 1024, the <tt>net_privaddr</tt> privilege
must also be asserted. Such bindings allow a process to accept connections
at all labels that are associated with the IP addresses to which
the process is bound. The labels that are associated with a network
interface are specified in the <tt>tnrhdb</tt> database and the <tt>tnrhtp</tt> database. The
labels can be specified by a range, by a set of explicit
enumerated labels, or by a combination of both.</p><p>When a privileged process that is bound to an MLP receives a
TCP request, the reply is automatically sent with the label of the
requester. For UDP datagrams, the reply is sent with the label that
is specified by the <tt>SO_RECVUCRED</tt> option.</p><p><a name="indexterm-80"></a><a name="indexterm-81"></a>The privileged process can implement a more restrictive MAC policy by comparing
the label of the request to other parameters. For example, a web
server could compare the label of the requesting process with the label
of the file specified in the URL. The remote label can be
determined by using the <tt>getpeerucred()</tt> function, which returns the credentials of the
remote peer. If the peer is running in a zone on the
same host, the <tt>ucred_get()</tt> library routine returns a full set of credentials.
Regardless of whether the peer is local or remote, the label of
the peer is accessible from the <tt>ucred</tt> data structure by using the
<tt>ucred_getlabel()</tt> function. This label can be compared with other labels by using
functions such as <tt>bldominates()</tt>.</p><p>A zone can have single-level ports and multilevel ports. See <a href="ipcapi-19.html">Multilevel Port Information</a>.</p>

<a name="api-intro-11"></a><h5>MAC-Exempt Sockets</h5>
<a name="indexterm-82"></a><a name="indexterm-83"></a><a name="indexterm-84"></a><a name="indexterm-85"></a><a name="indexterm-86"></a><a name="indexterm-87"></a><p>The Trusted Extensions software provides an explicit socket option, <tt>SO_MAC_EXEMPT</tt>, to specify
that the socket can be used to communicate with an endpoint at
a lower label.</p>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>The <tt>SO_MAC_EXEMPT</tt> socket option must <b>never</b> be used unintentionally. Use extreme caution
when using this socket option to disable MAC policy. When you must
use this mechanism, ensure that your client application enforces MAC policy.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Trusted Extensions software restricts the use of the <tt>SO_MAC_EXEMPT</tt> option in
these ways:</p>
<ul><li><p>To explicitly set the socket option, a process must assert the <tt>net_mac_aware</tt> privilege.</p></li>
<li><p>To further restrict the use of this socket option, the <tt>net_mac_aware</tt> privilege can be removed from the limit set for ordinary users.</p></li></ul>
<p>See the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2251/user-attr-4?a=view"><tt>user_attr</tt>(4)</a> man page for details.</p><p><a name="indexterm-88"></a>Sometimes, explicitly setting the socket option is not practical, such as when
the socket is managed by a library. In such circumstances, the socket
option can be set implicitly. The <tt>setpflags()</tt> system call enables you to
set the <tt>NET_MAC_AWARE</tt> process flag. Setting this process flag also requires the
<tt>net_mac_aware</tt> privilege. All sockets that are opened while the process flag is
enabled automatically have the <tt>SO_MAC_EXEMPT</tt> socket option set. See the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2241/setpflags-2?a=view"><tt>setpflags</tt>(2)</a> and
<a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2241/getpflags-2?a=view"><tt>getpflags</tt>(2)</a> man pages.</p><p>For applications that cannot be modified or recompiled, use the <tt>ppriv -M</tt> command
to pass the <tt>net_mac_aware</tt> process flag to the application. In this case,
all sockets that are opened by the application have the <tt>SO_MAC_EXEMPT</tt> option
set. However, child processes of the application do not have this process
flag or the related privilege.</p><p>Whenever you can, scrutinize and modify the source code of an application
when you need to use the <tt>SO_MAC_EXEMPT</tt> socket option. If you <b>cannot</b>
make such modifications to the code or if a safer method is
not available to you, you may use the <tt>ppriv -M</tt> command.</p><p>The <tt>SO_MAC_EXEMPT</tt> socket option has been used sparingly by the Solaris OS.
This option has been used by the NFS client. An NFS client
might need to communicate with an NFS server that runs at a
different label on an untrusted operating system. The NFS client enforces MAC
policy to ensure that inappropriate requests are not granted.</p><p>In the Solaris OS, both the NFS server and client code include
and enforce MAC policy so that communications between the Solaris client or
server and an untrusted client or server has MAC policy enabled. To
enable an untrusted host to communicate with a system that runs Trusted
Extensions, the untrusted host must have an entry in the <tt>tnrhdb</tt> database.

<a name="api-intro-4"></a><h4>Zones and Labels</h4>
<a name="indexterm-89"></a><a name="indexterm-90"></a><p>All objects on a system configured with Trusted Extensions are associated with
a zone. Such zones are called <b>labeled zones</b>. A labeled zone is a
non-global zone and is accessible to ordinary users. A user who is
cleared at more than one label is permitted access to a zone
at each of those labels.</p><p>The <b>global zone</b> is a special zone that contains files and processes that
control the security policy of the system. Files in the global zone
can only be accessed by roles and by privileged processes.</p>

<a name="api-intro-10"></a><h5>Labels in the Global Zone</h5>
<a name="indexterm-91"></a><a name="indexterm-92"></a><a name="indexterm-93"></a><a name="indexterm-94"></a><a name="indexterm-95"></a><a name="indexterm-96"></a><a name="indexterm-97"></a><p>The global zone is assigned a range of labels. The range is
from <tt>ADMIN_LOW</tt> to <tt>ADMIN_HIGH</tt>. <tt>ADMIN_HIGH</tt> and <tt>ADMIN_LOW</tt> are <b>administrative labels</b>.</p><p>Objects in the global zone that are shared with other zones are
assigned the <tt>ADMIN_LOW</tt> label. For example, files in the <tt>/usr</tt>, <tt>/sbin</tt>, and
<tt>/lib</tt> directories are assigned the <tt>ADMIN_LOW</tt> label. These directories and their contents
are shared by all zones. These files and directories are typically installed
from packages and are generally not modified, except during packaging or patching
procedures. To modify <tt>ADMIN_LOW</tt> files, a process must typically be run by
superuser or by someone who has all privileges.</p><p>Information that is private to the global zone is assigned the label
<tt>ADMIN_HIGH</tt>. For example, all processes in the global zone and all administrative
files in the <tt>/etc</tt> directory are assigned the <tt>ADMIN_HIGH</tt> label. Home directories
that are associated with roles are assigned the <tt>ADMIN_HIGH</tt> label. Multilevel information
that is associated with users is also assigned the <tt>ADMIN_HIGH</tt> label. See
<a href="#api-intro-7">Multilevel Operations</a>. Access to the global zone is restricted. Only system services and
administrative roles can execute processes in the global zone.</p>

<a name="api-intro-3"></a><h5>Labeled Zones</h5>
<a name="indexterm-98"></a><a name="indexterm-99"></a><a name="indexterm-100"></a><p>Non-global zones are called <b>labeled zones</b>. Each labeled zone has a unique label.
All objects within a labeled zone have the same label. For example,
all processes that run in a labeled zone have the same label.
All files that are writable in a labeled zone have the same
label. A user who is cleared for more than one label has
access to a labeled zone at each label.</p><p><a name="indexterm-101"></a><a name="indexterm-102"></a><a name="indexterm-103"></a>Trusted Extensions defines a set of label APIs for zones. These APIs
obtain the labels that are associated with labeled zones and the path
names within those zones:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>getpathbylabel()</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>getzoneidbylabel()</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>getzonelabelbyid()</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>getzonelabelbyname()</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>getzonerootbyid()</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>getzonerootbylabel()</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>getzonerootbyname()</tt></p></li></ul>
<p>For more information about these APIs, see <a href="labelapi-22.html#accessinglabelsinzones">Accessing Labels in Zones</a>.</p><p><a name="indexterm-104"></a><a name="indexterm-105"></a>The label of a file is based on the label of the
zone or of the host that owns the file. Therefore, when you
relabel a file, the file must be moved to the appropriate labeled
zone or to the appropriate labeled host. This process of relabeling a
file is also referred to as <b>reclassifying</b> a file. The <tt>setflabel()</tt> library
routine can relabel a file by moving the file. To relabel a
file, a process must assert the <tt>file_upgrade_sl</tt> privilege or the <tt>file_downgrade_sl</tt> privilege.
See the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2241/getlabel-2?a=view"><tt>getlabel</tt>(2)</a> and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2248/setflabel-3tsol?a=view"><tt>setflabel</tt>(3TSOL)</a> man pages.</p><p>For more information about setting privileges, see Developing Privileged Applications, in <i>Solaris Security for Developers Guide</i>.</p>
