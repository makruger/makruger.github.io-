to display a graphical user interface (GUI). You can upgrade your system's memory
and restart the installation.</p><p>To use less memory to install, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li><p>Restart the installation.</p></li>
<li><p>On the GRUB menu, select one of the Solaris Express Serial Console options instead of the Solaris Express Developer Edition option.</p><p>This alternative provides a text-mode installation that requires additional configuration input.

overwrites the existing Solaris file system with the new version of the Solaris
OS. If your system is not running the Solaris OS, you must perform
an initial installation.</p><p><b>CAUTION:</b> Note the following important considerations:</p>
<ul><li><p>On x86 systems, the installation overwrites the whole disk layout if one of the following is true:</p>
<ul><li><p>The disk table cannot be read.</p></li>
<li><p>The disk was not previously partitioned.</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>If an existing Solaris partition is on the disk, and the user makes no modifications to the partitions, the installation overwrites the Solaris partition only. Other existing partitions are not changed.</p></li></ul>
<p>An <b>upgrade</b> of the Solaris OS merges the new version of the Solaris
OS with the existing files on the system's disk or disks. An upgrade
saves as many modifications as possible that you have made to the previous
version of the Solaris OS. If you select Upgrade, an upcoming panel displays
all available operating systems and identifies which ones can be upgraded.</p><p>Additional options in the Welcome panel include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>You can choose to end the installation on any panel by selecting the Quit button.</p></li>
<li><p>If you click the Quit button, a dialog box asks you to confirm cancellation of the installation. On confirmation, a terminal window is opened where you can enter commands. Command options include:</p>
<ul><li><p>To reboot the system:</p><pre>% reboot</pre></li>

<li><b>In the following panel, indicate disk size and Solaris OS location.</b><br><img src="figures/4-diskInstall1.gif" alt="This panel enables you to select the disk where the Solaris OS will be installed. In this example, the users then chooses to partition the disk." width="867" height="672"></img><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
				 
<li><b>In the top portion of the panel, select the disk where the
Solaris OS will be installed.</b><p>The top portion of this panel displays the internal disks, external disks, and
solid-state drives that are available on the system. This panel also displays the
size of each disk in gigabytes. For details about a disk, move the
cursor over the disk icon. A pop-up window provides disk specifications.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>In order to be recognized by the installer, the disks and solid-state drives
must be turned on at the time the computer boots.</p>
<hr>
<p>The recommended minimum size for the Solaris OS installation is displayed. Disks that
are too small for a successful installation are labeled as such. The recommended
size is at least 20 Gbytes. If the partition is 20 Gbytes or
more, the installer creates a separate file system for the use of
Live Upgrade in the future. Also, more space is allocated for the <tt>/export/home</tt>
directory for the users.</p><p>Installation on a disk or partition that is smaller than recommended is permitted,
if this disk or partition is large enough to hold and run
the installed system. Smaller than recommended size installations might not enable you to fully
utilize the Live Upgrade feature. The absolute minimum is 8 Gbytes for an
English-only installation.</p></li>
<li><b>In the bottom portion of the panel, click to either Use the
whole disk or Partition on disk.</b><p>The bottom portion of this panel displays the existing disk partitioning.</p><p><b>CAUTION:</b> If the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed,
and the panel displays proposed partitioning. In this case, all data on the
disk is destroyed.</p><ul>
<li><b>If you choose to partition the disk, review the following partitioning guidelines:</b>
<ul><li><p>Only x86 based systems can be partitioned.</p></li>
<li><p>Only one Solaris partition is enabled.</p></li>
<li><p>You can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel. For this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation.</p>
<ul><li><p>The partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk.</p><p><b>CAUTION:</b> Resizing a partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions. Existing data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout. However, resizing the last partition or adding a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions. Non-Solaris partitions cannot be resized.</p></li>
<li><p>To make additional space available, change a non-Solaris partition to an Untyped partition.</p><p><b>CAUTION:</b> If you make this change, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Untyped partitions.</p></li>
<li><p>The Unallocated Available Space field tracks any disk space that has not been allocated to a specific partition. You can type &ldquo;=&rdquo; into any partition size field to alter its size so that remaining unallocated space is zero.</p></li></ul>
</li></ul>

<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Manual control of the Solaris file system layout is not supported. During the
installation, the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default file system layout.
All existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed. The default layout
is determined by the disk partition size according to preset defaults.</p><p>The default file system layout is as follows:</p>
<ul><li><p>If the disk size is less than 8 Gbytes, installation is not allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>For a disk size between 8 Gbytes and 10 Gbytes:</p><p>The default layout is swap=0.5 Gbyte, <tt>/export/home</tt>=0.5 Gbyte, and <tt>root(/)</tt>=7Gbytes.</p><p>For example, a 10 Gbytes disk partition has 1 Gbyte in swap, 1 Gbyte in the <tt>/export/home</tt> directory, and 8 Gbytes in the root(<tt>/</tt>) file system.</p></li>
<li><p>For a disk size between 10 Gbytes and 20 Gbytes:</p><p>The default layout is swap=1 Gbyte, root(<tt>/</tt>)=75% of the disk with minimum 8 Gbytes and maximum 15 Gbytes, and <tt>/export/home</tt>=remaining space.</p><p>For example, a 15 Gbytes disk partition has 1 Gbyte in swap, 2.8 Gbytes in the <tt>/export/home</tt> directory, and 11.2 Gbytes in the <tt>root(/)</tt> file system.</p></li>
<li><p>For a disk size between 20 Gbytes and 30 Gbytes:</p><p>The default layout is swap=2 Gbytes, <tt>root(/)</tt>=30% of total, the <tt>second_root(/)</tt> file system=30% of total (with minimum of 8 Gbytes), and <tt>/export/home</tt>=remaining space.</p><p>For example, a 25 Gbytes disk partition has 2 Gbytes in swap, 6 Gbytes in the <tt>/export/home</tt> directory, and 8.5 Gbytes each for the <tt>root(/)</tt> file system and the <tt>second_root(/)</tt> file system.</p></li>
<li><p>For a disk sizes greater than 30 Gbytes:</p><p>The default layout is swap=2 Gbytes, <tt>root(/)</tt>= 30% of total, the <tt>second_root(/)</tt> file system=30% (with minimum of 8 Gbytes and maximum of 15 Gbytes), and <tt>/export/home</tt>=remaining space.</p></li></ul>

the installed system:</p>
<ul><li><p>Text entry</p></li>
<li><p>Date and time formats </p></li>
<li><p>Currency symbols</p></li>
<li><p>Other language and location-sensitive settings</p></li></ul>
<p>Language support also includes system translations for the most commonly used languages, the
same languages that are available for this installer. For example, installing English and
French also installs the system translations for those languages. If the user sets
a less-commonly used language as the default language, English is used for system
messages.</p><p>Review the following guidelines:</p>
<ul><li><p>You can select multiple languages. Then, select one of these languages as your default language. The default selections are the installer language and the native languages for the country selected in the Time Zone panel.</p><p>The Default Language drop-down list displays all valid specific language and country options for the selected languages and selected country. For example, specific options for an English-speaking country might include English (UK), English (US), or English (Malta).</p></li>
<li><p>You can select all languages or deselect all languages. English C/POSIX is always installed. If you deselect all languages, the Default language drop-down list is automatically set to English C/POSIX.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the reset button to restore the panel to the initial default settings.</p></li></ul>

<li><p><tt>/a/var/sadm/system/logs/sysidtool.log</tt></p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the installation failed, close the installer and a terminal window opens to provide command-line access. You can use the command line to explore the cause of failure, reboot, or restart the installer as follows:</p>
<ul><li><p>Reboot the system:</p><pre>% reboot</pre></li>
<li><p>Restart the installer:</p><pre>% install-solaris</pre></li>
<li><p>View installation logs at the following location:</p><pre><tt>/a/var/sadm/system/logs/</tt></pre></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you have another operating system on your system, you might need to update the GRUB menu to add an OS to the menu. The GRUB menu displays a list of operating systems that can be booted. The Solaris OS and the Windows OS are displayed automatically on the GRUB menu. The contents of the GRUB <tt>menu.lst</tt> file dictate what is displayed in the GRUB menu when you boot the system. If you have an additional Solaris OS or a Linux OS, you need to edit the GRUB <tt>menu.lst</tt> file. For information about editing the GRUB <tt>menu.lst</tt> file, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2379/fvbsi?a=view">GRUB menu.lst File and Boot Time Interactions in <i>System Administration Guide: Basic Administration</i></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>After the system reboots, you can open a browser to review the Solaris Express Developer Edition information page.</p></li>
<li><p>During the installation, a root user is set up. After the installation, you can set up additional user names which can then be used to create logins to the system. On your first login by root after the installation, the Users &amp; Groups Admin tool starts. This tool can be used to set up these additional users. After this setup, log out and log back in as one of these new users. For further information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2379/usersetup-129?a=view">Setting Up User Accounts (Task Map) in <i>System Administration Guide: Basic Administration</i></a>.</p>
