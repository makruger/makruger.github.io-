<a name="ch6advtech-10"></a><h3>Supporting Relocation in a Heterogeneous Environment</h3>
<p><a name="indexterm-280"></a>The original concept behind System V packaging assumed one architecture per system. The
concept of a server did not play a role in the design. Now,
of course, a single server may provide support for several architectures, which means
there may be several copies of the same software on a server, each
for a different architecture. While Solaris packages are sequestered within recommended file system
boundaries (for example, <tt>/</tt> and <tt>/usr</tt>), with product databases on the server as
well as each client, not all installations necessarily support this division. Certain implementations
support an entirely different structure and imply a common product database. While pointing
the clients to different versions is straightforward, actually installing System V packages to
different base directories can introduce complications for the administrator.</p><p>When you design your package, you should also consider the common methods administrators
use for introducing new software versions. Administrators often seek to install and test
the latest version side-by-side with the currently installed version. The procedure involves installing
the new version to a different base directory than the current version and
directing a handful of non-critical clients to the new version as a test.
As confidence builds, the administrator redirects more and more clients to the new
version. Eventually, the administrator retains the old version only for emergencies and then
finally deletes it. </p><p>What this means is that packages destined for modern heterogeneous systems must support
true relocation in the sense that the administrator may put them any reasonable
place on the file system and still see full functionality. The Solaris 2.5
and compatible releases provide a number of useful tools which allow multiple architectures
and versions to install cleanly to the same system. Solaris 2.4 and compatible
versions also support true relocation but accomplishing the task is not quite as
obvious. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-11"></a><h4>Traditional Approach</h4>


<a name="ch6advtech-12"></a><h5>Relocatable Packages</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-281"></a>The System V ABI implies that the original intention behind the relocatable package
was to make installing the package more convenient for the administrator. Now the need
for relocatable packages goes much further. Convenience is not the only issue, rather
it is quite possible that during the installation an active software product is
already installed in the default directory. A package that is not designed to
deal with this situation either overwrites the existing product or fails to install.
However, a package designed handle multiple architectures and multiple versions can install smoothly
and offer the administrator a wide range of options that are fully compatible
with existing administrative traditions.</p><p>In some ways the problem of multiple architectures and the problem of multiple
versions is the same. It must be possible to install a variant
of the existing package side by side with other variants, and direct clients or
standalone consumers of exported file systems to any one of those variants, without
degraded functionality. While Sun has established methods for dealing with multiple architectures on
a server, the administrator may not adhere to those recommendations. All packages need
to be capable of complying with the administrators' reasonable wishes regarding installation. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-13"></a><h5>Example-A Traditional Relocatable Package</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-282"></a><a name="indexterm-283"></a>This example shows what a traditional relocatable package may look like. The package
is to be located in <tt>/opt/SUNWstuf</tt>, and its <tt>pkginfo</tt> file and <tt>pkgmap</tt> file might
look like this. </p>

installed to the base directory defined by the <tt>BASEDIR</tt> parameter from the <tt>pkginfo</tt>
file. For example, the first object in the <tt>pkgmap</tt> file is installed as
the directory <tt>/opt/SUNWstuf</tt>. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-15"></a><h5>Absolute Packages</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-286"></a>An absolute package is one that installs to a particular root (<tt>/</tt>) file system.
These packages are difficult to deal with from the standpoint of multiple versions
and architectures. As a general rule, all packages should be relocatable. There are,
however very good reasons to include absolute elements in a relocatable package. </p>

<p><a name="indexterm-287"></a><a name="indexterm-288"></a>If the <tt>SUNWstuf</tt> package was an absolute package, the <tt>BASEDIR</tt> parameter should not

it would be ignored by the <tt>pkgadd</tt> command. This package always installs to
<tt>/opt/SUNWstuf</tt> of the target system. </p><p>The <tt>-R</tt> argument to the <tt>pkgadd</tt> command works as expected. For example,</p><pre>pkgadd -d . -R /export/opt/client3 SUNWstuf</pre><p>installs the objects in <tt>/export/opt/client3/opt/SUNWstuf</tt>; but that is the closest this package comes
to being relocatable. </p><p>Notice the use of the question mark (<tt>?</tt>) for the <tt>/opt</tt> directory
in the <tt>pkgmap</tt> file. This indicates that the existing attributes should not be
changed. It does not mean &ldquo;create the directory with default attributes,&rdquo; although under
certain circumstances that may happen. Any directory that is specific to the new
package must specify all attributes explicitly.  </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-17"></a><h5>Composite Packages</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-290"></a><a name="indexterm-291"></a>Any package containing relocatable objects is referred to as a relocatable package. This
can be misleading because a relocatable package may contain absolute paths in its
<tt>pkgmap</tt> file. Using a root (<tt>/</tt>) entry in a <tt>pkgmap</tt> file can enhance the
relocatable aspects of the package. Packages that have both relocatable and root entries
are called <b>composite</b> packages. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-18"></a><h5>Example-A Traditional Solution</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-292"></a><a name="indexterm-293"></a>Assume that one object in the <tt>SUNWstuf</tt> package is a startup script executed at
run level 2. The file <tt>/etc/rc2.d/S70dostuf</tt> needs to be installed as a part
of the package, but it cannot be placed into the base directory. Assuming
that a relocatable package is the only solution, the <tt>pkginfo</tt> and a <tt>pkgmap</tt>
might look like this.</p>

absolute package. In fact, this would be better off as an absolute package&mdash;if the
administrator provided an alternate base directory for this package, it would not work!
</p><p>In fact, only one file in this package needs to be root-relative,
the rest could be moved anywhere. How to solve this problem through the
use of a composite package is discussed throughout the remainder of this section.</p>

<a name="ch6advtech-21"></a><h4>Beyond Tradition</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-295"></a><a name="indexterm-296"></a>The approach described in this section does not apply to all packages, but
it does result in improved performance during installation to an heterogeneous environment. Very
little of this applies to packages that are delivered as part of the
Solaris operating environment (bundled packages); however, unbundled packages can practice non-traditional packaging.</p><p>The reason behind encouraging relocatable packages is to support this requirement: </p><p><b>When a package is added or removed, the existing desirable behaviors of installed software products will be unchanged.</b> </p><p>Unbundled packages should reside under <tt>/opt</tt> so as to assure that the new
package does not interfere with existing products. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-22"></a><h5>Another Look at Composite Packages</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-297"></a>There are two rules to follow when constructing a functional composite package: </p>
<ul><li><p>Establish the base directory based upon where the vast majority of the package objects go. </p></li>
<li><p>If a package object goes into a common directory that is not the base directory (for example, <tt>/etc</tt>), specify it as an absolute path name in the <tt>prototype</tt> file. </p></li></ul>
<p>In other words, since &ldquo;relocatable&rdquo; means the object can be installed anywhere and
still work, no startup script run by <tt>init</tt> at boot time can be
considered relocatable! While there is nothing wrong with specifying <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> as a relative
path in the delivered package, there is only one place it can go.
</p>

<a name="ch6advtech-23"></a><h5>Making Absolute Path Names Look Relocatable</h5>
<p>If you are going to construct a composite package, the absolute paths must
operate in a manner which does not interfere with existing installed software. A
package that can be entirely contained in <tt>/opt</tt> gets around this problem since
there are no existing files in the way. When a file in <tt>/etc</tt>
is included in the package, you must ensure that the absolute path names
behave in the same way that is expected from relative path names. Consider
the following two examples. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-24"></a><h5>Example&mdash;Modifying a File</h5>


<a name="ch6advtech-25"></a><h5>Description</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-298"></a>An entry is being added to a table, or the object is
a new table which is likely to be modified by other programs or
packages. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-26"></a><h5>Implementation</h5>
<p>Define the object as file type <tt>e</tt> and belonging to the <tt>build</tt>, <tt>awk</tt>,
or <tt>sed</tt> class. The script that performs this task must remove itself as
effectively as it adds itself. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-27"></a><h5>Example</h5>
<p>An entry needs to be added to <tt>/etc/vfstab</tt> in support of the new
solid state hard disk. </p><p>The entry in the <tt>pkgmap</tt> file might be </p><pre>1 e sed /etc/vfstab ? ? ?</pre><p>The <tt>request</tt> script asks the operator if <tt>/etc/vfstab</tt> should be modified by
the package. If the operator answers &ldquo;no&rdquo; then the request script will print
instructions on how to do the job manually and will execute </p><pre>echo "CLASSES=none" &gt;&gt; $1</pre><p>If the operator answers &ldquo;yes&rdquo; then it executes </p><pre>echo "CLASSES=none sed" &gt;&gt; $1</pre><p>which activates the class action script that will make the necessary modifications. The
<tt>sed</tt> class means that the package file <tt>/etc/vfstab</tt> is a <tt>sed</tt> program
which contains both the install and remove operations for the same-named file on
the target system. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-28"></a><h5>Example&mdash;Creating a New File</h5>


<a name="ch6advtech-29"></a><h5>Description</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-299"></a>The object is an entirely new file that is unlikely to be
edited at a later time or, it is replacing a file owned by
another package. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-30"></a><h5>Implementation</h5>
<p>Define the package object as file type <tt>f</tt> and install it using a
class action script capable of undoing the change. </p>

<a name="ch6advtech-31"></a><h5>Example</h5>
<p>A brand new file is required in <tt>/etc</tt> to provide the necessary information
to support the solid state hard disk, named <tt>/etc/shdisk.conf</tt>. The entry in
the <tt>pkgmap</tt> file might look like this: </p><pre> 
.
.
.
1 f newetc /etc/shdisk.conf
.
.
.</pre><p>The class action script <tt>i.newetc</tt> is responsible for installing this and any other
files that need to go into <tt>/etc</tt>. It checks to make sure there
is not another file there. If there is not, it will simply copy
the new file into place. If there is already a file in
place, it will back it up before installing the new file. The script
<tt>r.newetc</tt> removes these files and restores the originals, if required. Here is the
key fragment of the install script.</p><pre># i.newetc
while read src dst; do
      if [ -f $dst ]; then
        dstfile=`basename $dst`
        cp $dst $PKGSAV/$dstfile
      fi
      cp $src $dst
done
 
if [ "${1}" = "ENDOFCLASS" ]; then
      cd $PKGSAV
      tar cf SAVE.newetc .
      $INST_DATADIR/$PKG/install/squish SAVE.newetc
fi</pre><p>Notice that this script uses the <tt>PKGSAV</tt> environment variable to store a backup
of the file to be replaced. When the argument <tt>ENDOFCLASS</tt> is passed
to the script, that is the <tt>pkgadd</tt> command informing the script that these
are the last entries in this class, at which point the script archives
and compresses the files that were saved using a private compression program stored
in the install directory of the package. </p><p><a name="indexterm-300"></a>While the use of the <tt>PKGSAV</tt> environment variable is not reliable during a package
update; if the package is not updated (through a patch, for instance) the
backup file is secure. The following remove script includes code to deal with
the other issue&mdash;the fact that older versions of the <tt>pkgrm</tt> command do
not pass the scripts the correct path to the <tt>PKGSAV</tt> environment variable.
</p><p>The removal script might look like this.</p><pre># r.newetc
 
# make sure we have the correct PKGSAV
if [ -d $PKG_INSTALL_ROOT$PKGSAV ]; then
      PKGSAV="$PKG_INSTALL_ROOT$PKGSAV"
fi
 
# find the unsquish program
UNSQUISH_CMD=`dirname $0`/unsquish
 
while read file; do
      rm $file
done
 
if [ "${1}" = ENDOFCLASS ]; then
      if [ -f $PKGSAV/SAVE.newetc.sq ]; then
         $UNSQUISH_CMD $PKGSAV/SAVE.newetc
      fi
 
      if [ -f $PKGSAV/SAVE.newetc ]; then
         targetdir=dirname $file    # get the right directory
         cd $targetdir
            tar xf $PKGSAV/SAVE.newetc
            rm $PKGSAV/SAVE.newetc
      fi
fi</pre><p>This script uses a private uninstalled algorithm (<tt>unsquish</tt>) which is in the install
directory of the package database. This is done automatically by the <tt>pkgadd</tt> command
at install time. All scripts not specifically recognized as install-only by the <tt>pkgadd</tt>
command are left in this directory for use by the <tt>pkgrm</tt> command. You cannot
count on where that directory is, but you can depend on the
directory being flat and containing all appropriate information files and installation scripts for the
package. This script finds the directory by virtue of the fact that the
class action script is guaranteed to be executing from the directory that contains
the <tt>unsquish</tt> program. </p><p>Notice, also, that this script does not just assume the target directory is
<tt>/etc</tt>. It may actually be <tt>/export/root/client2/etc</tt>. The correct directory could be constructed
in one of two ways. </p>
<ul><li><p>Use the <tt>${PKG_INSTALL_ROOT}/etc</tt> construction, or</p></li>
<li><p>Take the directory name of a file passed by the <tt>pkgadd</tt> command (which is what this script does). </p></li></ul>
<p>By using this approach for each absolute object in the package, you can
be sure that the current desirable behavior is unchanged or at least
recoverable.  </p>

it (which are already in place at install time) belong to the <tt>none</tt>
class. Even if the directories were unique to this package, you should leave
them in the <tt>none</tt> class. The reason for this is that the directories
need to be created first and deleted last, and this is always true
for the <tt>none</tt> class. The <tt>pkgadd</tt> command creates directories; they are not
copied from the package and they are not passed to a class action
script to be created. Instead, they are created by the <tt>pkgadd</tt> command before
it calls the install class action script, and the <tt>pkgrm</tt> command deletes directories after
completion of the removal class action script. </p><p><a name="indexterm-305"></a>This means that if a directory in a special class contains objects in
the class <tt>none</tt>, when the <tt>pkgrm</tt> command attempts to remove the directory,
it fails because the directory will not be empty in time. If an
object of class <tt>none</tt> is to be inserted into a directory of some
special class, that directory will not exist in time to accept the object.
The <tt>pkgadd</tt> command will create the directory on-the-fly during installation of the object
and may not be able to synchronize the attributes of that directory when
it finally sees the <tt>pkgmap</tt> definition.  </p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>When assigning a directory to a class, always remember the order of creation
and deletion.</p>
