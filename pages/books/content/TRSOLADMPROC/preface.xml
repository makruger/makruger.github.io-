</sect1><sect1 id="preface-3"><title>Trusted Extensions and the Solaris Operating System</title><para>Trusted Extensions runs on top of the Solaris Operating System (Solaris OS). Because Trusted Extensions software
can modify the Solaris OS, Trusted Extensions can require specific settings for Solaris installation
options.  Part I of this guide describes how to prepare the Solaris OS for Trusted Extensions,
 how to enable Trusted Extensions, and how to initially configure the software.
Part II of this guide describes how to administer the uniquely  Trusted Extensions features
