<a name="troubleshooting-7"></a><h4>Booting From Media, Error Messages</h4>
<p>le0: No carrier - transceiver cable problem<a name="troubleshooting-ix1012"></a><a name="troubleshooting-ix1013"></a><a name="troubleshooting-ix1014"></a><a name="troubleshooting-ix1017"></a><a name="indexterm-125"></a><a name="troubleshooting-ix1023"></a><a name="troubleshooting-ix1024"></a><a name="troubleshooting-ix1025"></a></p>Cause: <p>The system is not connected to the network.</p>Solution: <p>If this is a nonnetworked system, ignore this message. If this is a
networked system, ensure that the Ethernet cabling is attached securely.</p><p>The file just loaded does not appear to be executable</p>Cause: <p>The system cannot find the proper media for booting.</p>Solution: <p>Verify that the system has been set up properly to install the Solaris
Express 5/07 software from the network from an install server. The following are
examples of checks you can make.</p>
<ul><li><p>If you copied the images of the Solaris Operating System DVD or the Solaris Software CDs to the install server, ensure that you specified the correct platform group for the system when you set it up. </p></li>
<li><p>If you are using DVD or CD media, ensure that the Solaris Operating System DVD or Solaris Software - 1 CD is mounted and accessible on the install server.</p></li></ul>
<p>boot: cannot open &lt;<b>filename</b>> (<b>SPARC based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p>This error occurs when you override the location of the <tt>boot</tt> <tt>-file</tt> by
explicitly setting it.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b><b>filename</b> is a variable for the name of the file affected.</p>
<hr>
Solution: <p>Follow these instructions:</p>
<ul><li><p>Reset the <tt>boot</tt> <tt>-file</tt> in the PROM to &ldquo; &ldquo; (blank).</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the diag-switch is set to off and to true.</p></li></ul>
<p>Can't boot from file/device </p>Cause: <p>The installation media cannot find the bootable media.</p>Solution: <p>Ensure that the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul><li><p>The DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drive is installed properly and turned on.</p></li>
<li><p>Solaris Operating System DVD or the Solaris Software - 1 CD is inserted into the drive.</p></li>
<li><p>The disc is free of damage or dirt.</p></li></ul>
<p>WARNING: clock gained <i>xxx</i> days -- CHECK AND RESET DATE! (<b>SPARC based systems only</b>)</p>Description: <p>This is an informational message.</p>Solution: <p>Ignore the message and continue with the installation.</p><p>Not a UFS file system (<b>x86 based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p>When Solaris Express 5/07 software was installed (either through the Solaris installation program
or custom JumpStart), no boot disk was selected. You now must edit the
BIOS to boot the system.</p>Solution: <p>Select the BIOS to boot. See your BIOS documentation for instructions.</p>

<a name="troubleshooting-23"></a><h4>Booting From Media, General Problems</h4>
<p>The system does not boot.</p>Description: <p>When initially setting up a custom JumpStart server, you might encounter  boot
problems that do not return an error message.  To verify information about
the system and how the system is booting, run the boot command with
the <tt>-v</tt> option.  When you use the <tt>-v</tt> option, the boot command
 displays verbose debugging information about the screen.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>If this flag is not given, the messages are still printed, but the
output is directed to the system log file. For more information, see
<a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/syslogd-1m?a=view"><tt>syslogd</tt>(1M)</a>.</p>
<hr>
Solution: <p>For SPARC based systems, at the <tt>ok</tt> prompt, type the following command.</p><pre><tt><b>ok boot net -v - install</b></tt></pre><p>Boot from DVD media fails on systems with Toshiba SD-M 1401 DVD-ROM</p>Description: <p>If your system has a Toshiba SD-M1401 DVD-ROM with firmware revision 1007, the
system cannot boot from the Solaris Operating System DVD.</p>Solution: <p>Apply patch 111649&ndash;03, or later version, to update the Toshiba SD-M1401 DVD-ROM drive's
firmware. The patch 111649&ndash;03 is available at <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com">sunsolve.sun.com</a>.</p><p>The system hangs or panics when nonmemory PC cards are inserted. (<b>x86 based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p>Nonmemory PC cards cannot use the same memory resources that are used by
other devices.</p>Solution: <p>To correct this problem, see the instructions for your PC card and check
for the address range.</p><p>The system hangs before displaying the system prompt. (<b>x86 based systems only</b>)</p>Solution: <p>You have hardware that is not supported. Check your hardware manufacturer's documentation.</p>

<a name="troubleshooting-2"></a><h4>Booting From the Network, Error Messages</h4>
<p>WARNING: getfile: RPC failed: error 5 (RPC Timed out).</p>Description: <p>This error occurs when you have two or more servers on a network
responding to an install client's boot request. The install client connects to the
wrong boot server, and the installation hangs. The following specific reasons might cause
this error to occur:</p>Cause: <p><b>Reason 1:</b><tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> files might exist on different servers with an entry for this install
client.</p>Solution: <p><b>Reason 1:</b> Ensure that servers on the network do not have multiple <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> entries for
the install client. If they do have multiple entries, remove duplicate client entries
in the <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> file on all install servers and boot servers except the
one you want the install client to use.</p>Cause: <p><b>Reason 2:</b> Multiple <tt>/tftpboot</tt> or <tt>/rplboot</tt> directory entries might exist for this install client.</p>Solution: <p><b>Reason 2:</b> Ensure that servers on the network do not have multiple <tt>/tftpboot</tt> or
<tt>/rplboot</tt> directory entries for the install client. If they do have multiple entries,
remove duplicate client entries from the <tt>/tftpboot</tt> or <tt>/rplboot</tt> directories on all
install servers and boot servers except the one you want the install client
to use.</p>Cause: <p><b>Reason 3:</b> An install client entry might exist in the <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> file on a
server and an entry in another <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> file that enables all systems to access
the profile server. Such an entry resembles the following:</p><pre><tt>* install_config=</tt><i>profile_server</i><tt>:</tt><i>path</i></pre><p>A line that resembles the previous entry in the NIS or NIS+
<tt>bootparams</tt> table can also cause this error.</p>Solution: <p><b>Reason 3:</b> If a wildcard entry is in the naming service <tt>bootparams</tt> map or
table (for example, <tt>* install_config=</tt>), delete it and add it to the <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> file on
the boot server. </p><p>No network boot server. Unable to install the system.  See installation instructions.
(<b>SPARC based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p>This error occurs on a system that you are attempting to install from
the network. The system is not set up correctly.</p>Solution: <p>Ensure that you correctly set up the system to install from the network.
See <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2394/netinstall-40778?a=view">Adding Systems to Be Installed From the Network With a CD Image in <i>Solaris Express Installation Guide: Network-Based Installations</i></a>.</p><p>prom_panic: Could not mount file system (<b>SPARC based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p>This error occurs when you are installing Solaris from a network, but the
boot software cannot locate the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Solaris Operating System DVD, either the DVD or a copy of the DVD image on the install server</p></li>
<li><p>Solaris Software - 1 CD image, either the Solaris Software - 1 CD or a copy of the CD image on the install server</p></li></ul>
Solution: <p>Ensure that the installation software is mounted and shared. </p>
<ul><li><p>If you are installing Solaris from the install server's DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drive, ensure that the Solaris Operating System DVD or Solaris Software - 1 CD is inserted in the CD-ROM drive, is mounted, and is shared in the <tt>/etc/dfs/dfstab</tt> file.</p></li>
<li><p>If installing from a copy of the Solaris Operating System DVD image or Solaris Software - 1 CD image on the install server's disk, ensure that the directory path to the copy is shared in the <tt>/etc/dfs/dfstab</tt> file.</p></li></ul>
<p>Timeout waiting for ARP/RARP packet...(<b>SPARC based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p><b>Reason 1:</b> The client is trying to boot from the network, but it cannot
find a system that knows about the client.</p>Solution: <p><b>Reason 1:</b> Verify the system's host name is in the NIS or NIS+ naming
service. Also, verify the <tt>bootparams</tt> search order in the boot server's <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt>
file. </p><p>For example, the following line in the <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> file indicates that JumpStart
or the Solaris installation program first looks in the NIS maps for <tt>bootparams</tt>
information. If the program does not find any information, the installer looks in
the boot server's <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> file.</p><pre>bootparams: nis files</pre>Cause: <p><b>Reason 2:</b> The client's Ethernet address is not correct.</p>Solution: <p><b>Reason 2:</b> Verify that the client's Ethernet address in the install server's <tt>/etc/ethers</tt> file is
correct.</p>Cause: <p><b>Reason 3:</b> In a custom JumpStart installation, the <tt>add_install_client</tt> command specifies the platform group that
uses a specified server as an install server. If the wrong architecture value
is used when using the <tt>add_install_client</tt>, this problem occurs. For example, the machine
you want to install is a sun4u, but you used i86pc instead.</p>Solution: <p><b>Reason 3:</b> Rerun <tt>add_install_client</tt> with the correct architecture value.</p><p>ip: joining multicasts failed on tr0 - will use link layer broadcasts for
multicast (<b>x86 based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p><a name="troubleshooting-ix1043"></a>This error message is displayed when you boot a system with a token
ring card. Ethernet multicast and token ring multicast do not work the same
way. The driver returns this error message because an invalid multicast address was
provided to it. </p>Solution: <p>Ignore this error message. If multicast does not work, IP uses layer broadcasts
instead and does not cause the installation to fail.</p><p>Requesting Internet address for <i>Ethernet_Address</i> (<b>x86 based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p>The client is trying to boot from the network, but it cannot find
a system that knows about the client. </p>Solution: <p>Verify the system's host name is listed in the naming service. If the
system's host name is listed in the NIS or NIS+ naming service, and
the system continues to print this error message, try rebooting.</p><p>RPC: Timed out No bootparams (whoami) server responding; still trying... (<b>x86 based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p>The client is trying to boot from the network, but it cannot find
a system with an entry in the <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> file on the install server.</p>Solution: <p><a name="troubleshooting-ix1048"></a><a name="troubleshooting-ix1049"></a>Use <tt>add_install_client</tt> on the install server. Using this command adds the proper entry
in the <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> file, enabling the client to boot from the network.</p><p>Still trying to find a RPL server... (<b>x86 based systems only</b>)</p>Cause: <p>The system is trying to boot from the network, but the server is
not set up to boot this system.</p>Solution: <p>On the install server, execute <tt>add_install_client</tt> for the system to be installed.
The <tt>add_install_client</tt> command sets up an <tt>/rplboot</tt> directory, which contains the necessary network boot
program.</p><p><a name="indexterm-126"></a><a name="indexterm-127"></a><a name="indexterm-128"></a>CLIENT MAC ADDR: FF FF FF FF FF FF (<b>network installations with DHCP only</b>) </p>Cause: <p>The DHCP server is not configured correctly. This error might occur if the
options or macros are not correctly defined in the DHCP Manager software.</p>Solution: <p>In the DHCP Manager software, verify that the options and macros are correctly
defined. Confirm that the Router option is defined, and that the value of
the Router option is correct for the subnet you are using for the
network installation.</p>

<a name="troubleshooting-24"></a><h4>Booting From the Network, General Problems</h4>
<p><a name="troubleshooting-ix1051"></a><a name="troubleshooting-ix1052"></a>The system boots from the network, but from a system other than the
specified install server.  </p>Cause: <p>An <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> and perhaps an <tt>/etc/ethers</tt> entry exist on another system for the client.</p>Solution: <p><a name="troubleshooting-ix1053"></a><a name="indexterm-129"></a>On the name server, update the <tt>/etc/bootparams</tt> entry for the system that is being
installed. The entry should conform to the following syntax:</p><pre><i>install_system</i> root=<i>boot_server</i>:<i>path</i> install=<i>install_server</i>:<i>path</i></pre><p>Also, ensure that only one <tt>bootparams</tt> entry is on the subnet for the
install client. </p><p>The system does not boot from the network (<b>network installations with DHCP only</b>).</p>Cause: <p>The DHCP server is not configured correctly. This error might occur if the
system is not configured as an installation client on the DHCP server.</p>Solution: <p>In the DHCP manager software, verify that installation options and macros are defined
for the client system. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2394/dhcp-admin-38?a=view">Preconfiguring System Configuration Information With the DHCP Service (Tasks) in <i>Solaris Express Installation Guide: Network-Based Installations</i></a>.</p>
