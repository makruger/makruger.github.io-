             <a name="glossary-1"></a><h3>Glossary</h3><a name="glossary-11"></a><b>3DES</b><p>([Triple DES] Triple-Data Encryption Standard). A symmetric-key encryption method that  provides a
key length of 168 bits. </p><a name="glossary-12"></a><b>AES</b><p>(Advanced Encryption Standard) A symmetric 128-bit block data encryption technique. The  U.S.
government adopted the Rijndael variant of the algorithm as its encryption standard in
 October 2000. AES replaces DES encryption as the government standard.</p><a name="glossary-8"></a><b>archive</b><p>A file that contains a collection of files that were copied from a
master system. The file also contains identification information about the archive, such as
a name and the date that you created the archive. After you install
an archive on a system, the system contains the exact configuration of the
master system.</p><p>An archive could be a differential archive, which is a Solaris Flash archive
that contains only the differences between two system images, an unchanged master image
and an updated master image. The differential archive contains files to be retained,
modified, or deleted from the clone system.  A differential update changes only
the files specified and is restricted to systems that contain software consistent with
the unchanged master image.</p><a name="glossary-10"></a><b>arrow keys</b><p>One of the four directional keys on the numeric keypad.</p><a name="glossary-3"></a><b>begin script</b><p>A user-defined Bourne shell script, specified within the <tt>rules</tt> file, that performs

to boot the Solaris OS. These files are needed during system startup before
the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system is mounted. Two boot archives  are maintained
on a system:</p>
<ul><li><p>The boot archive that is used to boot the Solaris OS on a system. This boot archive is sometimes called the primary boot archive.</p></li>
<li><p>The boot archive that is used for recovery when the primary boot archive is damaged. This boot archive starts the system without mounting the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system.

including options, file names, and other expressions, and terminated by the end-of-line character.</p><a name="glossary-6zxcv"></a><b>concatenation</b><p>A RAID-0 volume. If slices are concatenated, the data is written to the
first available slice until that slice is full. When that slice is full,
the data is written to the next slice, serially. A concatenation provides no
data redundancy unless it is contained in a mirror. See also RAID-0
volume.</p><a name="glossary-7vcbn"></a><b>Core Software Group</b><p>A software group that contains the minimum software that is required to boot

<tt>rules</tt> file, that is a Bourne shell script that contains two types of
functions: probe and comparison. Probe functions gather the information you want or do
the actual work and set a corresponding <tt>SI_</tt> environment variable you define.
Probe functions become probe keywords. Comparison functions call a corresponding probe function, compare
the output of the probe function, and return 0 if the keyword matches
or 1 if the keyword doesn't match. Comparison functions become rule keywords. See
also <b>rules file</b>.</p><a name="glossary-decr"></a><b>decryption</b><p>The process of converting coded data to plain text.

is the only zone from which a non-global zone can be configured, installed,
managed, or uninstalled.  Administration of the system infrastructure, such as physical devices,
routing, or dynamic reconfiguration (DR), is only possible in the global zone. 
Appropriately privileged processes running in the global zone can access objects associated with
other zones.  See also <b>Solaris Zones</b> and <b>non-global zone</b>.</p><b>GRUB</b><p><b>x86 only</b>: GNU GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) is an open source boot loader

these various operating systems,  such as the Solaris OS, Linux, or Microsoft
Windows.</p><b>GRUB edit menu</b><p><b>x86 only</b>: A boot menu that is a submenu of the GRUB main menu.
GRUB commands  are displayed on this menu. These commands can be edited
to change  boot behavior.</p><b>GRUB main menu</b><p><b>x86 only</b>: A boot menu that lists the operating systems that are installed 
on a system. From this menu, you can easily boot an operating 
system without modifying the BIOS or <tt>fdisk</tt> partition settings.</p><a name="glossary-130lk"></a><b>hard link</b><p>A directory entry that references a file on disk. More than one such
directory entry can reference the same physical file.</p><a name="glossary-21kl"></a><b>hash</b><p>A number that is produced by taking some input and generating a number
that is significantly shorter than the input.  The same output value is
always generated for identical inputs. Hash functions can be used in table search
algorithms, in error detection, and in tamper detection. When used for tamper detection,
hash functions are chosen such that it is difficult to find two inputs
that yield the same hash result. MD5 and SHA-1 are examples of one-way
hash functions.  For example, a message digest takes a variable-length input such
as a disk file and reduces it to a small value.</p><a name="glossary-20kl"></a><b>hashing</b><p>The process of changing a string of characters into a value or key
that represents  the original string.</p><a name="glossary-22hj"></a><b>HMAC</b><p>Keyed hashing method for message authentication. HMAC is used with an iterative

</p><p>An initial installation of the Solaris OS overwrites the system's disk or disks
with the new version of the Solaris OS. If your system is not
running the Solaris OS, you must perform an initial installation.  If 
your system is running an upgradable version of the Solaris OS, an 
initial installation overwrites the disk and does not preserve the OS  or
local modifications.</p><a name="glossary-27er"></a><b>install server</b><p>A server that provides the Solaris DVD or CD images from which other
systems on a network can install Solaris (also called a <b>media server</b>). You
can create an install server by copying the Solaris DVD or CD images
to the server's hard disk.</p><a name="glossary-29we"></a><b>IP address</b><p>(Internet protocol address)  In TCP/IP, a unique 32-bit number that identifies each
host in a network. An IP address consists of four numbers that are
separated by periods (192.168.0.0, for example). Most often, each part of the IP
address is a number between 0 and 225. However, the first number must
be less than 224 and the last number cannot be 0.</p><p>IP addresses are logically divided into two parts: the network (similar to a
telephone area code), and the local system on the network (similar to a
phone number). The numbers in a Class A IP address, for example, represent
&ldquo;<tt>network.local.local.local</tt>&rdquo; and the numbers in a Class C IP address represent &ldquo;<tt>network.network.network.local</tt>.&rdquo;</p><a name="glossary-72sa"></a><b>IPv6</b><p>IPv6 is a version (version 6) of Internet Protocol (IP) that is designed
to be an evolutionary step from the current version, IPv4 (version 4). Deploying
IPv6, by using defined transition mechanisms, does not disrupt current operations. In addition,
IPv6 provides a platform for new Internet functionality. IPv6 is described in more
detail in<a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-3000/ipv6-overview-7?a=view">Chapter 3, Planning an IPv6 Addressing Scheme (Overview), in <i>System Administration Guide: IP Services</i></a>.</p><a name="glossary-16sd"></a><b>job</b><p>A user-defined task to be completed by a computer system.</p><a name="glossary-31js"></a><b>JumpStart directory</b><p>When you use a profile diskette for custom JumpStart installations, the JumpStart directory
is the root directory on the diskette that contains all the essential custom
JumpStart files. When you use a profile server for custom JumpStart installations, the

WAN boot  installation, the client system uses the keys to verify
the integrity of, or decrypt the  data and files transmitted from, the
server.</p><a name="glossary-42lan"></a><b>LAN</b><p>(local area network) A group of computer systems in close proximity that can
communicate by way of some connecting hardware and software.</p><a name="glossary-32ldap"></a><b>LDAP</b><p>(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) A standard, extensible directory access protocol that is used
by LDAP naming service clients and servers to communicate with each other.</p><a name="glossary-33locale"></a><b>locale</b><p>A geographic or political region or community that shares the same language, customs,
or cultural conventions (English for the U.S. is <tt>en_US</tt>, and English for the
U.K. is <tt>en_UK</tt>).</p><a name="glossary-210l"></a><b>logical device</b><p>A group of physical slices on one or more disks that appear to
