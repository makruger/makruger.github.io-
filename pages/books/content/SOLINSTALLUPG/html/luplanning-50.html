<a name="luplanning-50"></a><h3>Guidelines for Selecting Slices for File Systems</h3>
<p><a name="indexterm-33"></a>When you create file systems for a boot environment, the rules are identical
to the rules for creating file systems for the Solaris OS. Solaris Live
Upgrade cannot prevent you from creating invalid configurations for critical file systems. For
example, you could type a <tt>lucreate</tt> command that would create separate file systems for
root (<tt>/</tt>) and <tt>/kernel</tt> which is an invalid division of the root (<tt>/</tt>)
file system. </p><p>Do not overlap slices when reslicing disks. If this condition exists, the new
boot environment appears to have been created, but when activated, the boot environment
does not boot. The overlapping file systems might be corrupted.</p><p>For Solaris Live Upgrade to work properly, the <tt>vfstab</tt> file on the active
boot environment must have valid contents and must have an entry for the
root (<tt>/</tt>) file system at the minimum.</p>

<a name="luplanning-70"></a><h4>Guidelines for Selecting a Slice for the root (<tt>/</tt>) File System</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-34"></a>When you create an inactive boot environment, you need to identify a slice
where the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system is to be copied. Use the following
guidelines when you select a slice for the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system. The
slice must comply with the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Must be a slice from which the system can boot.</p></li>
<li><p>Must meet the recommended minimum size.</p></li>
<li><p>Can be on different physical disks or the same disk as the active root (<tt>/</tt>) file system.</p></li>
<li><p>Can be a Veritas Volume Manager volume (VxVM). If VxVM volumes are configured on your current system, the <tt>lucreate</tt> command can create a new boot environment. When the data is copied to the new boot environment, the Veritas file system configuration is lost and a UFS file system is created on the new boot environment.</p></li></ul>


<a name="luplanning-19"></a><h4>Guidelines for Selecting Slices for Mirrored File Systems</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-35"></a><a name="indexterm-36"></a>You can create a new boot environment that contains any combination of physical
disk slices, Solaris Volume Manager volumes, or Veritas Volume Manager volumes. Critical file
systems that are copied to the new boot environment can be of the
following types: </p>
<ul><li><p>A physical slice.</p></li>
<li><p>A single-slice concatenation that is included in a RAID-1 volume (mirror). The slice that contains the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system can be a RAID-1 volume. </p></li>
<li><p>A single-slice concatenation that is included in a RAID-0 volume. The slice that contains the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system can be a RAID-0 volume.</p></li></ul>
<p>When you create a new boot environment, the <tt>lucreate</tt> <tt>-m</tt> command recognizes
the following three types of devices:</p>
<ul><li><p>A physical slice in the form of /dev/dsk/c<i>w</i>t<i>x</i>d<i>y</i>s<i>z</i></p></li>
<li><p>A Solaris Volume Manager volume in the form of /dev/md/dsk/d<i>num</i></p></li>
<li><p>A Veritas Volume Manager volume in the form of /dev/vx/dsk/<i>volume_name</i>. If VxVM volumes are configured on your current system, the <tt>lucreate</tt> command can create a new boot environment.  When the data is copied to the new boot environment, the Veritas file system configuration is lost and a UFS file system is created on the new boot environment.</p></li></ul>

<hr><p><b>Note - </b>If you have problems upgrading with Veritas VxVM, see <a href="troubleshooting-16510.html#troubleshooting-48">System Panics When Upgrading With Solaris Live Upgrade Running Veritas VxVm</a>.</p>
<hr>


<a name="luplanning-6"></a><h5>General Guidelines When Creating RAID-1 Volumes (Mirrored) File Systems</h5>
<p>Use the following guidelines to check if a RAID-1 volume is busy,
resyncing, or if volumes contain file systems that are in use by 
a Solaris Live Upgrade boot environment.</p><p>For volume naming guidelines, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-0157/epudh?a=view">RAID Volume Name Requirements and Guidelines for Custom JumpStart and Solaris Live Upgrade in <i>Solaris Express Installation Guide: Planning for Installation and Upgrade</i></a>.</p>

<a name="luplanning-17"></a><h5>Checking Status of Volumes</h5>
<p>If a mirror or submirror needs maintenance or is busy, components cannot be
detached. You should use the <tt>metastat</tt> command before creating a new boot environment
and using the <tt>detach</tt> keyword. The <tt>metastat</tt> command checks if the mirror is
in the process of resynchronization or if the mirror is in use. For
information, see the man page <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2240/metastat-1m?a=view"><tt>metastat</tt>(1M)</a>.</p>

<a name="luplanning-18"></a><h5>Detaching Volumes and Resynchronizing Mirrors</h5>
<p>If you use the <tt>detach</tt> keyword to detach a submirror, <tt>lucreate</tt> checks
if a device is currently resyncing. If the device is resyncing, you cannot
detach the submirror and you see an error message.</p><p>Resynchronization is the process of copying data from one submirror to another submirror
after the following problems:</p>
<ul><li><p>Submirror failures.</p></li>
<li><p>System crashes.</p></li>
<li><p>A submirror has been taken offline and brought back online.</p></li>
<li><p>The addition of a new submirror.</p></li></ul>
<p>For more information about resynchronization, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2789/about-metadevices-25868?a=view">RAID-1 Volume (Mirror) Resynchronization in <i>Solaris Volume Manager Administration Guide</i></a>.</p>

<a name="luplanning-19vol"></a><h5>Using Solaris Volume Manager Commands</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-37"></a><a name="indexterm-38"></a>Use the <tt>lucreate</tt> command rather than Solaris Volume Manager commands to manipulate volumes
on inactive boot environments. The Solaris Volume Manager software has no knowledge of
boot environments, whereas the <tt>lucreate</tt> command contains checks that prevent you from inadvertently
destroying a boot environment. For example, <tt>lucreate</tt> prevents you from overwriting or deleting a
Solaris Volume Manager volume.</p><p>However, if you have already used Solaris Volume Manager software to create complex
Solaris Volume Manager concatenations, stripes, and mirrors, you must use Solaris Volume Manager
software to manipulate them. Solaris Live Upgrade is aware of these components and
supports their use. Before using Solaris Volume Manager commands that can create, modify,
or destroy volume components, use the <tt>lustatus</tt> or <tt>lufslist</tt> commands. These commands can determine
which Solaris Volume Manager volumes contain file systems that are in use by
 a Solaris Live Upgrade boot environment.</p>

<a name="luplanning-80"></a><h4>Guidelines for Selecting a Slice for a Swap File System</h4>
<p>These guidelines contain configuration recommendations and examples for a swap slice.</p>

<a name="luplanning-14swap"></a><h5>Configuring Swap for the New Boot Environment</h5>
<p>You can configure a swap slice in three ways by using the
<tt>lucreate</tt> command with the <tt>-m</tt> option:</p>
<ul><li><p>If you do not specify a swap slice, the swap slices belonging to the current boot environment are configured for the new boot environment. </p></li>
<li><p>If you specify one or more swap slices, these slices are the only swap slices that are used by the new boot environment. The two boot environments do not share any swap slices.</p></li>
<li><p>You can specify to both share a swap slice and add a new slice for swap. </p></li></ul>
<p>The following examples show the three ways of configuring swap. The current boot
environment is configured with the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system on <tt>c0t0d0s0</tt>. The swap
file system is on <tt>c0t0d0s1</tt>.</p>
<ul><li><p>In the following example, no swap slice is specified. The new boot environment contains the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system on <tt>c0t1d0s0</tt>. Swap is shared between the current and new boot environment on <tt>c0t0d0s1</tt>.</p><pre># <tt><b>lucreate -n be2 -m /:/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0:ufs</b></tt></pre></li>
<li><p>In the following example, a swap slice is specified. The new boot environment contains the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system on <tt>c0t1d0s0</tt>. A new swap file system is created on <tt>c0t1d0s1</tt>. No swap slice is shared between the current and new boot environment.</p><pre># <tt><b>lucreate -n be2 -m /:/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0:ufs -m -:/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s1:swap</b></tt></pre></li>
<li><p>In the following example, a swap slice is added and another swap slice is shared between the two boot environments. The new boot environment contains the root (<tt>/</tt>) file system on <tt>c0t1d0s0</tt>. A new swap slice is created on <tt>c0t1d0s1</tt>. The swap slice on <tt>c0t0d0s1</tt> is shared between the current and new boot environment.</p><pre># <tt><b>lucreate -n be2 -m /:/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0:ufs -m -:shared:swap -m -:/dev/dsk/c0t1d0s1:swap</b></tt></pre></li></ul>


<a name="luplanning-13lu"></a><h5>Failed Boot Environment Creation if Swap is in Use</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-39"></a>A boot environment creation fails if the swap slice is being used by
any boot environment except for the current boot environment. If the boot environment
was created using the <tt>-s</tt> option, the alternate-source boot environment can use the
swap slice, but not any other boot environment. </p>

<a name="luplanning-16"></a><h4>Guidelines for Selecting Slices for Shareable File Systems</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-40"></a>Solaris Live Upgrade copies the entire contents of a slice to the designated
new boot environment slice. You might want some large file systems on that
slice to be shared between boot environments rather than copied to conserve space
and copying time. File systems that are critical to the OS such as
root (<tt>/</tt>) and <tt>/var</tt> must be copied. File systems such as <tt>/home</tt> are
not critical file systems and could be shared between boot environments. Shareable file
systems must be user-defined file systems and on separate swap slices on both
the active and new boot environments. You can reconfigure the disk several ways,
depending  your needs. </p><table><col width="58.76*"><col width="61.28*"><col width="29.97*"><tr><th align="left" valign="top" scope="column"><p>Reconfiguring a disk</p></th>

<tt>/home</tt> on its own slice. When you create any new boot environments, <tt>/home</tt>
is shared with the new boot environment by default.</p></td>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>If you want to share
a directory, the directory must be split off to its own slice. The
directory is then a file system that can be shared with another boot
environment. You can use the <tt>lucreate</tt> command with the <tt>-m</tt> option to create
a new boot environment and split a directory off to its own slice.
But, the new file system cannot yet be shared with the original boot
environment. You need to run the <tt>lucreate</tt> command with the <tt>-m</tt> option again
to create another boot environment. The two new boot environments can then share
the directory. </p></td>
<td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>For example, if you wanted to upgrade from the 
Solaris 9 release to the Solaris Express 5/07 release and share <tt>/home</tt>, you could
run the <tt>lucreate</tt> command with the <tt>-m</tt> option. You could  create a
Solaris 9 release with <tt>/home</tt> as a separate file system on its own
slice. Then run the <tt>lucreate</tt> command with the <tt>-m</tt> option again to duplicate
that boot environment. This third boot environment can then be upgraded to the
Solaris Express 5/07 release. <tt>/home</tt> is shared between the Solaris 9 and
Solaris Express 5/07 releases. </p></td>
