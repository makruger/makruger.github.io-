<a name="jumpstartoverview-1"></a><h3>Custom JumpStart Introduction</h3>
<p>The custom JumpStart installation method is a command&ndash;line interface that enables you to
automatically install or upgrade several systems, based on profiles that you create. The
profiles define specific software installation requirements. You can also incorporate shell scripts to
include preinstallation and postinstallation tasks. You choose which profile and scripts to use
for installation or upgrade. The custom JumpStart installation method installs or upgrades the system,
based on the profile and scripts that you select. Also, you can use
a <tt>sysidcfg</tt> file to specify configuration information so that the custom JumpStart installation
is completely hands-off.</p>

<a name="fxjww"></a><h4>Custom JumpStart Example Scenario</h4>
<p>The custom JumpStart process can be described by using an example scenario. In
this example scenario, the systems need to be set up with the
following parameters:</p>
<ul><li><p>Install Solaris on 100 new systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Seventy of the systems are SPARC based systems that are owned by the engineering group and need to be installed as standalone systems with the Solaris OS software group for developers.</p></li>
<li><p>The remaining 30 systems are x86 based, owned by the marketing group and need to be installed as standalone systems with the Solaris OS software group for end users.</p></li></ul>
<p>First, the system administrator must create a <tt>rules</tt> file and a profile for
each group of systems. The <tt>rules</tt> file is a text file that contains
a rule for each group of systems or single systems on which you
want to install the Solaris software. Each rule distinguishes a group of systems
that are based on one or more system attributes. Each rule also links
each group to a profile.</p><p>A profile is a text file that defines how the Solaris software
is to be installed on each system in the group. Both the <tt>rules</tt>
file and profile must be located in a JumpStart directory.</p><p>For the example scenario, the system administrator creates a <tt>rules</tt> file that
contains two different rules, one for the engineering group and another for the
marketing group. For each rule, the system's network number is used to distinguish
the engineering group from the marketing group.</p><p>Each rule also contains a link to an appropriate profile. For example, in
the rule for the engineering group, a link is added to the
profile, <tt>eng_profile</tt>, which was created for the engineering group. In the rule for
the marketing group, a link is added to the profile, <tt>market_profile</tt>, which
was created for the marketing group.</p><p>You can save the <tt>rules</tt> file and the profiles on a diskette or
on a server. </p>
<ul><li><p>A profile diskette is required when you want to perform custom JumpStart installations on nonnetworked, standalone systems.</p></li>
<li><p>A profile server is used when you want to perform custom JumpStart installations on networked systems that have access to a server.</p></li></ul>
<p>After creating the <tt>rules</tt> file and profiles, validate the files with the <tt>check</tt>
script. If the <tt>check</tt> script runs successfully, the <tt>rules.ok</tt> file is created. The
<tt>rules.ok</tt> is a generated version of the <tt>rules</tt> file that the JumpStart program
uses to install the Solaris software.</p>
