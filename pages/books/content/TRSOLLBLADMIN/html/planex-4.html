<a name="planex-4"></a><h3>Identifying the Site's Label Requirements</h3>
<a name="indexterm-271"></a><p>SecCompany, Inc. is a fictional name for the company whose label requirements are
modeled in this example. To protect the corporation's intellectual property, the company's legal
department mandates that employees use three labels on all sensitive email and printed
materials. The three labels, from most sensitive to least sensitive are the following:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>SecCompany Confidential: Registered</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>SecCompany Confidential: Need To Know</tt></p></li>
<li><p><tt>SecCompany Confidential: Internal Use Only</tt></p></li></ul>
<p>The legal department also approves the use of an optional fourth label,
<tt>Public</tt>. The <tt>Public</tt> label is for information that can be distributed to anyone
without restrictions.</p>

<a name="planex-11"></a><h4>Satisfying Information Protection Goals</h4>
<a name="indexterm-272"></a><p>At SecCompany, Inc, the manager in charge of Information Protection makes use of
all possible channels to communicate labeling requirements. However, some employees do not understand
the requirements. Other employees forget about requirements or ignore the requirements. Even when
labels are properly applied, the information is not always properly handled, stored, and
distributed. For example, reports indicate that even Registered information is sometimes found unattended. Copies
of Registered information have been left next to copy machines and printers, in
break rooms, or in lobbies.</p><p>The legal department wants a better way to ensure that information is properly
labeled without relying totally on employee compliance. The system administrators want a better
way to control the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Who can see or modify sensitive information</p></li>
<li><p>Which information is printed on which printers</p></li>
<li><p>How printer output is handled</p></li>
<li><p>How email at various levels of security is distributed internally and externally</p></li></ul>


<a name="planex-28965"></a><h4>Trusted Extensions Features That Address Labeling and Access</h4>
<a name="indexterm-273"></a><p>Trusted Extensions software does not leave labeling up to the discretion of computer
users. All printer output from print servers that are configured with Trusted Extensions
is automatically labeled according to the site's requirements.</p><p>Even though security was not yet fully understood at the company, executives knew
that Trusted Extensions could implement certain features immediately.</p>
<ul><li><p>Automatic labeling of print jobs</p></li>
<li><p>Printers with restricted access by label</p></li>
<li><p>Email with restricted access by label</p></li></ul>
<a name="planex-fig-2"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;6-1 Automatic Labeling of Print Jobs</h6><img src="figures/Planex.fig546.gif" alt="The context describes the graphic."></img><p>Each print job is automatically assigned a <b>label</b>. The label corresponds either to
the <b>level</b> at which the user is working or to the user's level
of responsibility.</p><p><a href="#planex-fig-2">Figure&nbsp;6-1</a> shows an employee working at a level of <tt>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt>. At this level, the
work should only be accessible by SecCompany employees and others who have signed
nondisclosure agreements. When the employee sends email to the printer, the print job
is automatically assigned the label <tt>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt>.</p><a name="planex-fig-3"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;6-2 Label Automatically Printed on Body Pages</h6><img src="figures/Planex.fig539.gif" alt="The context describes the graphic."></img><p>The printer automatically prints a company-specified label at the top and bottom of
each page of printed output.</p><p><a href="#planex-fig-3">Figure&nbsp;6-2</a> shows the letter that was sent to the printer in <a href="#planex-fig-2">Figure&nbsp;6-1</a> being
printed with the user's working label. The label, <tt>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt>, is printed at
the top and bottom of every page.</p><a name="planex-fig-6"></a>Example&nbsp;6-1 Handling Guidelines on Banner and Trailer Pages<p>This example shows the wording for a print job whose sensitivity level has
a classification of <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW</tt> and a department of <tt>HUMAN_RESOURCES</tt>. Banner and trailer
pages are automatically created for each print job and are printed with company-specific
handling guidelines.</p><pre>NEED_TO_KNOW HR

DISTRIBUTE ONLY TO HUMAN RESOURCES (NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT REQUIRED)</pre><p>Printed below the sensitivity label, <b>handling instructions</b> provides distribution instructions for the printed material.
The instructions state  that the information should be distributed only to human
resources personnel who need to know the information. Also, a reader must have
signed a nondisclosure agreement.</p><p>Printers can be configured to print only jobs with labels within a
restricted label range. For example, <a href="#planex-fig-5">Figure&nbsp;6-3</a> illustrates that the legal department's printer has been
set up to print only jobs that have been assigned one of three
labels:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>NEED_TO_KNOW LEGAL</tt> &ndash; Can be viewed only by employees with a need to know within the legal department</p></li>
<li><p><tt>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt> &ndash; Can be viewed only by permanent employees of the SecCompany company and customers who have signed nondisclosure agreements</p></li>
<li><p><tt>PUBLIC</tt> &ndash; Can be viewed by anyone</p></li></ul>
<p>This printer setup excludes jobs that are sent at any other label.
For example, this printer would reject jobs at the labels <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW MARKETING</tt> and <tt>REGISTERED</tt>.</p><a name="planex-fig-5"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;6-3 How a Printer With a Restricted Label Range Handles Jobs</h6><img src="figures/fig547.gif" alt="The context describes the graphic."></img><p>Printers in locations that are accessible to all employees can be similarly restricted.
For example, printers can be configured to print jobs only at the two
labels that all employees can view, <tt>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt> and <tt>PUBLIC</tt>.</p><p>Similar to how the printer label range controls which jobs can be
printed on a particular printer, a user's <b>account sensitivity label range</b> limits which email the person can
handle. <a href="#planex-fig-7">Figure&nbsp;6-4</a> shows email that is being labeled at the sensitivity label
of the user's mail application. The email is sent to the mail application
at that label.</p><a name="planex-fig-7"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;6-4 A User Receiving Email Within the Account Label Range</h6><img src="figures/fig548.gif" alt="Illustration shows that email labeled "Need_to_know Sales" and "Registered" does not get delivered to the user. "></img><p>Gateways to the Internet were set up to screen email so that
emails at inappropriate labels could not be sent outside of the company. Inappropriate labels
are any labels except <tt>PUBLIC</tt>.</p>
