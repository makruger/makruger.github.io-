<a name="printl-4"></a><h3>Specifying Channels</h3>
<p><a name="indexterm-228"></a><a name="indexterm-229"></a>The <tt>CHANNELS</tt> section in the <tt>label_encodings</tt> file defines the lines that can
appear below the <tt>PRINTER BANNER</tt> lines on the lower third of the banner
and trailer pages. The <tt>CHANNELS</tt> section can be specified to print a string whenever
the label of a print job contains a certain compartment.</p><p>Commercial sites can customize the text in the <tt>CHANNELS</tt> section with any compartment
bit. <a href="#printl-fig-16">Figure&nbsp;4-7</a> shows a <tt>CHANNELS</tt> warning on a print job's banner page at
a commercial site. </p><a name="printl-fig-16"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;4-7 Commercial Use of <tt>CHANNELS</tt> on Banner Page</h6><img src="figures/PrintBanrBotmChannels.gif" alt="The context describes the graphic."></img><p>In U.S. government installations, the channels lines of the banner page conventionally show
the warnings that are associated with the <b>compartments</b> of the job's label.
<a href="#printl-fig-17">Figure&nbsp;4-8</a> shows a typical <tt>CHANNELS</tt> warning on a print job's banner page at
a government installation: <tt>HANDLE VIA (CH B)/(CH A) CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt>.</p><p>The following discussion shows how the <tt>CHANNELS</tt> string <tt>HANDLE VIA (CH B)/(CH A) CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt> is specified for
a job whose label includes the compartment words <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>. For the purpose
of the example, only <tt>(CH A)</tt> and <tt>(CH B)</tt> apply. However, since the compartment
bit for a third channel <tt>(CH C)</tt> is included in their definitions, <tt>(CH C)</tt>
is also mentioned in this discussion.</p><p><a name="indexterm-230"></a>The example illustrates these features:</p>
<ul><li><p>Two compartment bits are associated individually with one set of words and together with another set of words</p></li>
<li><p>A third compartment bit is included with the encodings for the first two bits</p></li>
<li><p>One suffix is defined for whenever <b>any combination of one or more</b> channel words is in the label</p></li>
<li><p>Another suffix is defined for when a <b>single</b> channel word is in the label</p></li>
<li><p>A third suffix is defined for when more than one channel word is in the print job's label</p></li></ul>
<a name="printl-fig-17"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;4-8 U.S. Government Use of <tt>CHANNELS</tt> Specification on Banner Page</h6><img src="figures/la3-15.gif" alt="The context describes the graphic." width="588" height="189"></img><p><a name="indexterm-231"></a><a name="indexterm-232"></a>As shown in the following example, two suffixes <tt>CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt> and <tt>CHANNELS ONLY</tt> and
a prefix <tt>HANDLE VIA</tt> are defined.</p><a name="printl-ex-18"></a>Example&nbsp;4-3 Suffixes and Prefixes in the <tt>CHANNELS</tt> Section in a Government <tt>label_encodings</tt> File<pre>CHANNELS:

WORDS:
name= CHANNELS JOINTLY;         suffix;
name= CHANNELS ONLY;            suffix;
name= HANDLE VIA;               prefix;</pre><p><a name="indexterm-233"></a><a name="indexterm-234"></a>After the prefixes and suffixes are defined as in <a href="#printl-ex-18">Example&nbsp;4-3</a>, the channel
names <tt>(CH A)</tt>, <tt>(CH B)</tt>, and <tt>(CH C)</tt> are specified in two different ways to achieve
the following results:</p>
<ul><li><p>Whenever any one of the three compartment bits associated with channels is in the label, the <tt>HANDLE VIA:</tt> prefix is printed.</p></li>
<li><p>When only one of the three compartment bits associated with channels is in the label, the <tt>CHANNELS ONLY</tt> suffix is printed after the channel name <tt>(CH A)</tt>, <tt>(CH B)</tt>, or <tt>(CH C)</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>When more than one compartment bit that is associated with channels is in the label, the prefix is followed by the channel names separated by a slash (/). This channel name is then followed by the <tt>CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt> suffix.</p><p>The first three lines that define <tt>CHANNELS</tt> words in <a href="#printl-ex-18">Example&nbsp;4-3</a> are repeated in <a href="#printl-ex-19">Example&nbsp;4-4</a>. The second examples focuses on how <tt>(CH A)</tt>, <tt>(CH B)</tt>, and <tt>(CH C)</tt> are encoded to appear with the <tt>CHANNELS ONLY</tt> suffix:</p></li>
<li><p><tt>(CH A)</tt> is encoded with bit 0 on and bits 1 and 6 explicitly set to off using the tilde (~): 0 ~1 ~6</p></li>
<li><p><tt>(CH B)</tt> is encoded with bit 1 on and bits 0 and 6 explicitly set to off using the tilde (~): ~0 1 ~6</p></li>
<li><p><tt>(CH C)</tt> is encoded with bit 6 on and bits 0 and 1 explicitly set to off using the tilde (~): ~0 ~1 6</p></li></ul>

name= (CH B);   prefix= HANDLE VIA; suffix= CHANNELS ONLY;
compartments= ~0 1 ~6;
name= (CH C);   prefix= HANDLE VIA; suffix= CHANNELS ONLY;
compartments= ~0 ~1 6;</pre><p>The first three lines of channel name definitions in the <tt>CHANNELS</tt> section that
is shown in <a href="#printl-ex-19">Example&nbsp;4-4</a> have the following results:</p>
<ul><li><p>The <tt>HANDLE VIA</tt> prefix and the <tt>CHANNELS ONLY</tt> suffix are printed when <b>one</b> of the words that is associated with bits 0, 1, and 6 elsewhere in the <tt>label_encodings</tt> is in the job's label</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>HANDLE VIA</tt> prefix and <tt>CHANNELS ONLY</tt> suffix are printed:</p>
<ul><li><p>With <tt>(CH A)</tt> when compartment bit 0 is turned on in the label and compartment bits 1 and 6 are off</p></li>
<li><p>With <tt>(CH B)</tt> when compartment bit 1 is turned on in the label and compartment bits 0 and 6 are off</p></li>
<li><p>With (CH C) when compartment bit 6 is turned on in the label and compartment bits 0 and 1 are off</p><p>The last three lines that define <tt>CHANNELS WORDS</tt> in <a href="#printl-ex-19">Example&nbsp;4-4</a> are repeated in <a href="#printl-ex-20">Example&nbsp;4-5</a>. The repetition shows how <tt>(CH A)</tt>, <tt>(CH B)</tt>, and <tt>(CH C)</tt> are encoded to appear with the <tt>CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt> suffix when more than one of the words associated with bits 0, 1, and 6 is in the job's label. A slash is inserted between the channels names when more than one of the bits defined in the channels section is in the job's label.</p></li></ul>

<a name="printl-ex-20"></a>Example&nbsp;4-5 Encodings for More Than One Channel in <tt>CHANNELS</tt> Section in Government Encodings File<pre>name= (CH A);   prefix= HANDLE VIA; suffix= CHANNELS ONLY; compartments= 0 ~1 ~6;
name= (CH B);   prefix= HANDLE VIA; suffix= CHANNELS ONLY; compartments= ~0 1 ~6;

name= (CH C);   prefix= HANDLE VIA; suffix= CHANNELS JOINTLY; compartments= 6;
name= (CH B);   prefix= HANDLE VIA; suffix= CHANNELS JOINTLY; compartments= 1;
name= (CH A);   prefix= HANDLE VIA; suffix= CHANNELS JOINTLY; compartments= 0;</pre><p>The <tt>CHANNELS</tt> specification in <a href="#printl-ex-20">Example&nbsp;4-5</a> illustrates the importance of order when compartments are
being encoded. The first three lines handle the cases when only one of
the channels compartment bits is turned on, so the last three lines can
handle cases when more than one bit is turned. Therefore, none of the
last three lines need to have any compartment bits explicitly set to 0.
The result of these last three lines is that the suffix <tt>CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt>
is always printed when any of two or more of the three
compartment words that are associated with the channels is in the label.</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>(CH C)</tt> is printed with <tt>CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt> when bit 6 is turned on, and either of bit 0 or 1 or both are also turned on.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>(CH B)</tt> is printed with <tt>CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt> when bit 1 is turned on, and either of bit 0 or 6 or both are also turned on.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>(CH A)</tt> is printed with <tt>CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt> when compartment 0 is turned on, and either of bit 6 or 1 or both are also turned on.</p></li></ul>
<p>The following example shows that compartment bit 6 is associated with the label
word <tt>CC</tt>.</p><a name="printl-ex-21"></a>Example&nbsp;4-6 Label <tt>WORDS</tt> Associated With Compartment Bit 6<pre>SENSITIVITY LABELS:

<li><p>The sensitivity label has two access-related words, <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>, that are associated with two compartment bits, 0 and 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Because two of the bits that are defined for <tt>CHANNELS</tt> words appear in the job's label, the <tt>CHANNELS WORDS (CH A)</tt> and <tt>(CH B)</tt> are followed by <tt>CHANNELS JOINTLY</tt>.</p><p><a name="indexterm-235"></a><a name="indexterm-236"></a>Any string that should print before the channel name is specified as a <b>prefix</b>.
