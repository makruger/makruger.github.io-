<a name="planex-6"></a><h3>Analyzing the Requirements for Each Label</h3>
<a name="indexterm-274"></a><a name="indexterm-275"></a><p>The security administrator agrees that the set of labels that are mandated by
the legal department is a useful starting point. However, the further analysis is
needed before the labels can be encoded.</p>

<a name="planex-8"></a><h4>Requirements for <tt>CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt></h4>
<a name="indexterm-276"></a><a name="indexterm-277"></a><p>The <tt>CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt> label is for information that is proprietary to the company but
which, because of its low level of sensitivity, can be distributed to all
employees. All employees have signed nondisclosure agreements before starting employment. Information with this label
might also be distributed to others. For example, the employees of vendors and
contractors who have signed a nondisclosure agreement can receive the information. Because the
Internet can be snooped, information with this label cannot be sent over the
Internet. The information can be sent over email within the company.</p><p>Candidates for the <tt>CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt> label include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Spending guidelines</p></li>
<li><p>Internal job postings</p></li></ul>


<a name="planex-9"></a><h4>Requirements for <tt>CONFIDENTIAL: NEED_TO_KNOW</tt></h4>
<a name="indexterm-278"></a><a name="indexterm-279"></a><p>The <tt>CONFIDENTIAL: NEED_TO_KNOW</tt> label is intended for information that is proprietary to the company,
has a higher level of sensitivity than <tt>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt>, and has a more limited audience.
Distribution is limited to employees who need to know the information. Other people
who need to know the information and who have signed nondisclosure agreements might
also be in the audience.</p><p>For example, if only the group of people working in a particular
project should see certain information, then <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW</tt> should be used on that information. Whenever
information should be restricted to a particular group, the name of the group
should be specified on the paper version of the information.</p><p>Having the name of a group in this label makes it clear
that the information should not be given to anyone outside of the group.
Information with this label cannot be sent over the Internet but it can
be sent over email within the company.</p><p>Candidates for the <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW</tt> label include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Product design documents</p></li>
<li><p>Project details</p></li>
<li><p>Employee Status Change form</p></li></ul>


<a name="planex-10"></a><h4>Requirements for <tt>CONFIDENTIAL: REGISTERED</tt></h4>
<a name="indexterm-280"></a><a name="indexterm-281"></a><p>The <tt>CONFIDENTIAL: REGISTERED</tt> classification is intended for information that is proprietary to the company,
has a very high level of sensitivity, and could significantly harm the company
if released. Registered information must be numbered and be tracked by the owner.
Each copy must be assigned to a specific person. The copy must be
returned to the owner for destruction after being read. Copies can be made
only by the owner of the information. Use of brownish-red paper is recommended
because this color cannot be copied.</p><p>This label is to be used when only one specific group of
people should be allowed to see the proprietary information. This information cannot be shown
to anyone who is not authorized by the owner. The information cannot be
shown to employees of other companies who have not signed a nondisclosure agreement,
even if the owner authorizes the disclosure. Information with this label cannot be
sent through email.</p><p>Candidates for the <tt>CONFIDENTIAL: REGISTERED</tt> label include the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>End of quarter financial information that has not yet been released</p></li>
<li><p>Sales forecasts</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing forecasts</p></li></ul>


<a name="planex-21"></a><h4>Names of Groups With <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW</tt> Label</h4>
<a name="indexterm-282"></a><p>The security administrator decided that the <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW</tt> label should contain the names of
groups or departments. The security Administrator asked for suggestions about what words to
use to define groups or areas of interest within the organization. The following
items were in the initial list:</p>
<ul><li><p>Engineering</p></li>
<li><p>Executive Management</p></li>
<li><p>Finance</p></li>
<li><p>Human Resources</p></li>
<li><p>Legal</p></li>
<li><p>Manufacturing</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing</p></li>
<li><p>Sales</p></li>
<li><p>System Administration</p></li></ul>
<p>Later, the security administrator added the Project Team group, which enabled all members
of the Engineering and Marketing groups to share project data.</p>

<a name="planex-21281"></a><h4>Understanding the Set of Labels</h4>
<p>The next step is to resolve the following issues:</p>
<ul><li><p>How to use the classifications and compartments to encode the labels and clearances</p></li>
<li><p>Which handling instructions should appear on printed output</p></li></ul>
<p>The security administrator used a large board. Pieces of paper were marked with
the words that should be in the labels, as shown in <a href="#planex-fig-11">Figure&nbsp;6-5</a>.
This setup graphed the relationships. The pieces could be rearranged until all the
pieces fit together.</p><p>The administrator drafted the following label relationships:</p>
<ul><li><p>The four labels are hierarchical with the label that contains <tt>REGISTERED</tt> the highest. The <tt>PUBLIC</tt> label is the lowest.</p></li>
<li><p>Only one label needs to be associated with group names</p><p>The list of people who are cleared to receive registered information is limited on a case by case basis. Therefore, <tt>REGISTERED</tt> does not need any group names. <tt>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt> applies to all employees and people who have signed nondisclosure agreements and <tt>PUBLIC</tt> labels are for everybody. Therefore, <tt>INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</tt> and <tt>PUBLIC</tt> labels do not need further qualification. The <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW</tt> label does need to be associated with non-hierarchical words, such as <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW MARKETING</tt> or <tt>NEED_TO_KNOW ENGINEERING</tt>. The words that identify the group or department can also be included in a user's clearance, as part of establishing that user's need to know.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the labels except <tt>PUBLIC</tt> requires the person who is accessing the information to have signed a nondisclosure agreement.</p><p>A phrase such as <tt>NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT REQUIRED</tt> would be a good reminder that this requirement exists.</p></li>
<li><p>The handling instructions on banner and trailer pages should have clear wording on how to handle the information. How to handle the information is based on the classification and on any group name that can appear in the label.</p><p>Along with information on the sensitivity of the printer output, handling instructions should print that a nondisclosure agreement is required when the label requires such an agreement.</p></li></ul>
