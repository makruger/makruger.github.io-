<a name="sliminstall"></a><h3>Installing OpenSolaris 2009.06 From the Live CD</h3>
<p>You can install the OpenSolaris to your hard driver. An existing Solaris
<tt>fdisk</tt> partition is overwritten during the initial installation.</p>

<a name="gfstb"></a><h4>How to Install OpenSolaris 2009.06 from the Live CD</h4><h6>Before You Begin</h6><p>Before installing the OpenSolaris operating system, review the system requirements and limitations described
in the preceding sections of this document.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Before you install the OpenSolaris operating system on a system that is running
the Linux operating system, save a copy of the <tt>menu.lst</tt> file. The
contents of the GRUB <tt>menu.lst</tt> file determine what is displayed in the GRUB
menu when you boot the system. You will need to update the GRUB
menu after the installation. For further information, see <tt>menu.lst</tt> file specifics at
<a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2379/hbx86boot-68676?a=view">x86: Booting a Solaris System with GRUB</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The following are the default settings that are used by the OpenSolaris installer:</p>
<ul><li><p>The installation uses an existing partition or a new created Solaris <tt>fdisk</tt> partition to create a ZFS storage pool. If a second disk is available, you can add a second disk to the ZFS pool to create a mirrored configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>This release installs an OpenSolaris system that is automatically networked by using DHCP with DNS name resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>The <tt>nwamd</tt> daemon is enabled by default. <tt>nwamd</tt> introduces an alternate instance of the network or physical SMF service that enables automated network configuration.</p><p>For further information, see the <tt>nwamd</tt>(1M) man page. The <tt>nwamd</tt>(1M) man page provides instructions about how to disable or enable the network/physical:<tt>nwam</tt> instance.</p></li>
<li><p>IPv6 is disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>The DNS domain and server IP addresses are retrieved from the DHCP server.</p></li>
<li><p>The NFSv4 domain is dynamically derived.</p></li>
<li><p>Kerberos is disabled.</p></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><b>To start the installer from the Live CD desktop, select the Install OpenSolaris
icon on the Live CD desktop.</b>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>If you are prompted to log in to the Live CD, both
the user name and password are <tt><b>jack</b></tt>. The root password is <tt><b>opensolaris</b></tt>.</p>
<hr>
<p>A text prompt enables you to select an installer language before the installer
begins. The default language is English.</p><p>The installer begins.</p></li>
<li><b>Complete any additional selections in the preliminary installation panels.</b><p>Note the following important considerations:</p>
<ul><li><p>The installation overwrites the whole disk layout if one of the following is true:</p>
<ul><li><p>The disk table cannot be read.</p></li>
<li><p>The disk was not previously partitioned.</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>If an existing Solaris <tt>fdisk</tt> partition is on a multiboot system, and the user makes no modifications to the existing partitions, the installation overwrites the Solaris <tt>fdisk</tt> partition only. Other existing partitions are not changed.</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><b>In the Disk panel, select disk and partition location for the OpenSolaris operating
system.</b><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><b>In the top portion of the Disk panel, select the disk where
the OpenSolaris operating system will be installed.</b><p>The top portion of this panel displays the internal disks, external disks, and
solid-state drives that are available on the system. This panel also displays the
size of each disk in gigabytes.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>To be recognized by the installer, the disks and solid-state drives must be
plugged in before the installer begins.</p>
<hr>
<p>The recommended size and minimum size for the OpenSolaris operating system installation are
displayed. Disks that are too small for a successful installation are labeled as
such. The recommended size is at least 9 Gbytes.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>A maximum of 2 Tbytes on a disk or on a partition
is usable for installing the OpenSolaris 2009.06 release, even if the disk or
partition is larger than 2 Tbytes.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><b>In the bottom portion of the Disk panel, click either Use the whole
disk or Partition the disk.</b><p>The bottom portion of this panel displays the existing disk partitioning.</p>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>If the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and
the panel displays proposed partitioning. In this case, all data on the disk
is destroyed.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><b>If you choose to partition the disk, review the following partitioning guidelines, then
revise the partitioning panel settings as needed.</b>
<ul><li><p>Only one Solaris partition is allowed. If an existing Solaris partition is available, that Solaris partition will be the target for the installation. Or, if you do not have an existing Solaris partition, you can change any existing partition to a Solaris partition.</p></li>
<li><p>You can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel. For this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation.</p>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>The partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk. Resizing a Solaris partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions. Existing data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout. However, resizing the last partition or appending a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions. Non-Solaris partitions cannot be resized.</p>
<hr>

<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>To make additional space available, you can change an existing partition to Unused. However, if you change an existing partition to Unused, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Unused.</p>
<hr>

<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>New partitions can only use the available space that follows the last defined partition. The installer cannot utilize unallocated chunks of space between existing defined partitions. Use the <tt>fdisk(1M)</tt> command to create new partitions that use the free space between exiting partitions.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p>If you used a third-party partitioning tool such as GParted, then the Disk panel displays a partition named Linux-swap on which you can install the OpenSolaris operating system.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>In this panel, use the drop-down list for the Linux-swap partition name to change the partition name to Solaris.</p>
<hr>
</li></ul>

<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Manual control of the OpenSolaris file system layout is not supported. During the
installation, the Solaris <tt>fdisk</tt> partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system
layout. All existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed.</p><p>The installation uses a Solaris <tt>fdisk</tt> partition to create a ZFS storage pool.</p><p>If a second disk is available, you can, after the installed system
has been booted, add a second disk to the ZFS pool to create
a mirrored configuration. To create a mirrored configuration, use the ZFS <tt>attach</tt> command to
add a second disk to the storage pool. For example:</p><pre># <tt>zpool attach rpool c0t2d0s0 c0t4d0s0</tt></pre><p>The following example illustrates a ZFS file system setup with a redundant configuration:</p><pre># zpool status
  pool: rpool
 state: ONLINE
 scrub: none requested
config:

NAME          STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
rpool         ONLINE       0     0     0
mirror        ONLINE       0     0     0
c0t2d0s0      ONLINE       0     0     0
c0t4d0s0      ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors </pre>
<hr>
</li>
<li><b>In the same panel, you can choose instead to install the OpenSolaris operating
system on the whole disk.</b>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>This option erases the existing disk. The entire disk is overwritten with the
new OpenSolaris operating system.</p>
<hr>
</li></ul><p>When you have revised the partitioning as needed, click Next.</p></li></ol></li>
<li><b>Complete time zone, date, and time settings.</b><p>The next panel enables you to type the correct time zone, date, and
time for the system to be installed.  Select a time zone or
location where the computer is typically used. The top half of the panel
displays a world map with major cities marked. The bottom half of the
panel provides drop-down selections. You can choose the time zone either from the
map or from the drop-down list.</p><ul>
<li><b>If you select the time zone from the map, click on a
city or click anywhere on the map.</b><p>If you click on the map, but not on a city, the map
automatically magnifies that area. You can click on a location within that magnified
area. You can drag the cursor to move the magnified area to a
different location on the map.  When you select a site on
the map, the drop-down selections automatically populate with the time zone, date, and
current time for that map selection. You can right-click to deselect magnification.</p></li>
<li><b>Instead of using the map, you can make your selections in the drop-down
fields.</b><p>Select your region, then select Location. Finally, select time zone.  The options
for each drop-down field are determined by the selection made in the prior
drop-down field.</p></li></ul>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>You can edit the default date and time that is provided.</p>
<hr>
<p>When the settings are correct, click Next.</p></li>
<li><b>Select language and locale, then click Next.</b><p>The next panel enables you to select a language and locale. These selections
determine the language support, the default date and time, and other data formats
for the installed system.</p>
<ul><li><p>You can accept the default language selection or change the selection.</p></li>
<li><p>A language selection is required. You can select &ldquo;no default language support.&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>The language chosen automatically determines the available locales in the drop-down list. Only one locale can be selected.</p></li></ul>

<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Any time that you log in to the installed system, you can
change either the locale for that particular session or the default locale by
using the Options button in the Login dialog box.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><b>Complete the user settings and click Next.</b><p>Review the following guidelines:</p>
<ul><li><p>Root login is not enabled either on the Live CD or on the installed system. You must log in as the user that you create in this panel. After you log in, you can then become root to configure the system.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>If you do not create a user account in this panel, root is set up as a normal account on the installed system, instead of as a role. This is the only situation where you can log in to the installed system as root.</p>
<hr>
<p>For further information, see <a href="login.html">Troubleshooting Login and Root Specifications</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Both the root password and user account are optional. However, for better security, complete these fields.</p><p>If the root password is not defined, a reminder is displayed when you click Next. If you do not want to define a root password, you can proceed.</p></li>
<li><p>A user account requires only a Login name for the account to be valid. For better security, however, do complete all fields.</p><p>If the user account information is not valid, a reminder is displayed when you click Next. If you do not want to define a user account, you can proceed.</p></li>
<li><p>Type a computer name or accept the default. The computer name field cannot be blank.</p></li></ul>
<p>For further information, see <a href="http://dlc.sun.com/osol/docs/content/dev/getstart/setusers.html">Setting Up Users</a>.</p></li>
<li><b>In the Install panel, review and confirm installation specifications.</b>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>The installation begins when you click Install. Do not interrupt an installation in
progress.</p>
<hr>
<p>During the installation, a progress bar is displayed.</p><p>The final panel displays completion messages. You can review the installation log in
this panel. You can either quit or reboot from this panel.</p><ul>
<li><b>After a successful installation, to start the installed system, select Reboot. The reboot
process might take a few minutes.</b>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Eject the Live CD as the next boot begins. Or, select the
&ldquo;Boot from Hard Disk&rdquo; option in the GRUB menu.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><b>To exit, select Quit and shut down your system.</b></li></ul></li></ol><h6>Next Steps</h6><p>After you have installed the OpenSolaris software, if you have another operating system
on your system, you might need to manually update the GRUB menu. The
GRUB menu displays a list of operating systems that can be booted. Solaris
and Windows operating systems are displayed automatically in the GRUB menu. The contents
of the GRUB <tt>menu.lst</tt> file determine what is displayed in the GRUB menu
when you boot the system. If you have installed an additional OpenSolaris release,
or the Linux operating system, you will need to edit the GRUB <tt>menu.lst</tt>
file to manually add these entries. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-2379/hbx86boot-68676?a=view">x86: Booting a Solaris System with GRUB</a>.</p><p>If you are unable to log in to your installed system, or
if you want to customize the roles that were set up during the
installation, see <a href="login.html">Troubleshooting Login and Root Specifications</a>.</p>
