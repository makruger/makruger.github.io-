network administrator for use by mobile nodes that need a home address.</p><a name="glossary-36"></a><b>AES</b><p>Advanced Encryption Standard. A symmetric 128-bit block data encryption technique. The U.S. government

A symmetric-key encryption method developed in 1975 and standardized by
ANSI in 1981 as ANSI X.3.92. DES uses a 56-bit key.</p><a name="glossary-54"></a><b>Diffie-Hellman protocol</b><p>Also known as public key cryptography. An asymmetric cryptographic key agreement protocol that
was developed by Diffie and Hellman in 1976. The protocol enables two users
to exchange a secret key over an insecure medium without any prior secrets.
Diffie-Hellman is used by the IKE protocol.</p><a name="glossary-102"></a><b>diffserv model</b><p>Internet Engineering Task Force architectural standard for implementing differentiated services on IP networks.
