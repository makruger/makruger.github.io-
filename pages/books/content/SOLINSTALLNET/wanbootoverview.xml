</highlights><sect1 id="wanboottasks2-105"><title>What Is WAN Boot?</title><para>The WAN boot installation method enables you to boot and install software over
a wide area network (WAN) by using HTTP. By using WAN boot, you
can install the Solaris OS on SPARC based systems over a large public
network where the network infrastructure might be untrustworthy. You can use
WAN boot with security features to protect data confidentiality and installation
image integrity.</para><para>The WAN boot installation method enables you to transmit an encrypted
Solaris Flash archive over a public network to a remote SPARC based client.
The WAN boot programs then install the client system by performing a custom
JumpStart installation. To protect the integrity of the installation, you
can use private keys to authenticate and encrypt data. You can also transmit
your installation data and files over a secure HTTP connection by configuring
your systems to use digital certificates.</para><para>To perform a WAN boot installation, you install a SPARC
based system by downloading the following information from a web server over
a HTTP or secure HTTP connection.</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para><filename>wanboot</filename> program &ndash;
The <filename>wanboot</filename> program is the second level boot program
that loads the WAN boot miniroot, client configuration files, and installation
files. The <filename>wanboot</filename> program performs tasks similar to
those that are performed by the <filename>ufsboot</filename> or <filename>inetboot</filename> second level boot programs.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>WAN boot file system &ndash;
WAN boot uses several different files to configure the client and retrieve
data to install the client system. These files are located in the <filename>/etc/netboot</filename> directory of the web server. The <filename>wanboot-cgi</filename> 
program transmits these files to the client as a file system, called the WAN
boot file system.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>WAN boot miniroot &ndash; The WAN boot miniroot is a version of
the Solaris miniroot that has been modified to perform a WAN boot installation.
The WAN boot miniroot, like the Solaris miniroot, contains a kernel and just
enough software to install the Solaris environment. The WAN boot miniroot
contains a subset of the software in the Solaris miniroot.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Custom JumpStart configuration files &ndash; To install the
system, WAN boot transmits <filename>sysidcfg</filename>, <filename>rules.ok</filename>,
and profile files to the client. WAN boot then uses these files to perform
a custom JumpStart installation on the client system.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Solaris Flash archive &ndash; A Solaris Flash archive is a
collection of files that you copy from a master system. You can then use this
archive to install a client system. WAN boot uses the custom JumpStart installation
method to install a Solaris Flash archive on the client system. After you
install an archive on a client system, the system contains the exact configuration
of the master system.</para><note><para>The <command>flarcreate</command> command no longer has size limitations on individual files. You
can create a Solaris Flash archive that  contains individual files over
4 Gbytes.</para><para>For more information, see <olink targetdoc="solinstallflash" targetptr="gbwbm" remap="external"><citetitle remap="section">Creating an Archive That Contains Large Files</citetitle> in <citetitle remap="book">Solaris Express Installation Guide: Solaris Flash Archives (Creation and Installation)</citetitle></olink>.</para>

SPARC based systems that are located in geographically remote areas. You might
want to use WAN boot to install remote servers or clients that are accessible
only over a public network.</para><para>If you want to install systems that are located on your local area network
(LAN), the WAN boot installation method might require more configuration and administration
than necessary. For information about how to install systems over a LAN, see <olink targetptr="netinstalloverview-28995" remap="internal">Chapter&nbsp;4, Installing From the Network

</sect2><sect2 id="wanboottasks2-66"><title>Protecting Data During a WAN Boot Installation</title><para>The WAN boot installation method enables you to use hashing keys, encryption
keys, and digital certificates to protect your system data during the installation.
This section briefly describes the different data protection methods that
are supported by the WAN boot installation method.</para><sect3 id="wanboottasks2-111"><title>Checking the Integrity of Data With a
Hashing Key</title><para>To protect the data you transmit from the
WAN boot server to the client, you can generate a Hashed Message Authentication
Code (HMAC) key. You install this hashing key on both the WAN boot server
and the client. The WAN boot server uses this key to sign the data to be transmitted
to the client. The client then uses this key to verify the integrity of the
data that is transmitted by the WAN boot server. After you install a hashing
key on a client, the client uses this key for future WAN boot installations.</para><para>For instructions about how to use a hashing key, see <olink targetptr="wanboottasks2-51" remap="internal">(Optional) To Create a Hashing Key and an Encryption
Key</olink>.</para>
</sect3><sect3 id="wanboottasks2-112"><title>Encrypting Data With Encryption Keys</title><para>The WAN boot installation method enables you to encrypt
the data you transmit from the WAN boot server to the client. You can use
WAN boot utilities to create a Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) or Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) encryption key. You can then provide this key to
both the WAN boot server and the client. WAN boot uses this encryption
key to encrypt the data sent from the WAN boot server to the client.
The client can then use this key to decrypt the encrypted configuration files
and security files that are transmitted during the installation.</para><para>Once you install an encryption key on a client, the client uses this
key for future WAN boot installations.</para><para>Your site might not permit the use of encryption keys. To determine
if your site permits encryption, ask your site's security administrator. If
your site permits encryption, ask your security administrator which type of
encryption key, either 3DES or AES, you should use.</para><para>For instructions on how to use encryption keys, see <olink targetptr="wanboottasks2-51" remap="internal">(Optional) To Create a Hashing Key and an Encryption
Key</olink>.</para>
</sect3><sect3 id="wanboottasks2-113"><title>Protecting Data by Using HTTPS</title><para>WAN boot supports the use of HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS)
to transfer data between the WAN boot server and the client. By
using HTTPS, you can require the server, or both the server and the client,
to authenticate themselves during the installation. HTTPS also encrypts the
data that is transferred from the server to the client during the installation.</para><para>HTTPS uses digital certificates to authenticate systems that exchange
data over the network. A digital certificate is a file that identifies a system,
either a server or client, as a system to trust during online communication.
You can request a digital certificate from an external certificate authority,
or create your own certificate and certificate authority.</para><para>To enable the client to trust the server and accept data from the server,
you must install a digital certificate on the server. You then instruct the
client to trust this certificate. You can also require the client to authenticate
itself to the servers by providing a digital certificate to the client. You
can then instruct the server to accept the certificate's signer when the client
presents the certificate during the installation.</para><para>To use digital certificates during the installation, you must configure
your web server to use HTTPS. See your web server documentation for information
about how to use HTTPS.</para><para>For information about the requirements to use digital certificates during
your WAN boot installation, see <olink targetptr="wanboottasks2-70" remap="internal">Digital
Certificate Requirements</olink>. For instructions about how to use digital
certificates in your WAN boot installation, see <olink targetptr="wanboottasks2-93" remap="internal">(Optional) To Use Digital Certificates for Server
and Client Authentication</olink>.</para>

</sect1><sect1 id="wanboottasks2-30"><title>Security Configurations Supported by WAN Boot (Overview)</title><para>WAN boot supports varying levels of security. You can use a combination
of the security features that are supported in WAN boot to meet the needs
of your network. A more secure configuration requires more administration,
but also protects your system data to a greater extent. For more critical
systems, or those systems you want to install over a public network, you might
choose the configuration in <olink targetptr="wanboottasks2-68" remap="internal">Secure WAN
Boot Installation Configuration</olink>. For less critical systems, or systems
on semi-private networks, consider the configuration that is described in <olink targetptr="wanboottasks2-65" remap="internal">Insecure WAN Boot Installation Configuration</olink>.</para><para>This section briefly describes the different configurations you can
use to set the level of security for your WAN boot installation.
The section also describes the security mechanisms that are required by these
configurations.</para><sect2 id="wanboottasks2-68"><title>Secure WAN Boot Installation
Configuration</title><para>This configuration protects the integrity of the data exchanged between
the server and client, and helps keep the contents of the exchange confidential.
This configuration uses an HTTPS connection, and uses either the 3DES or AES
algorithm to encrypt the client configuration files. This configuration also
requires the server to authenticate itself to the client during the installation.

</sect2><sect2 id="wanboottasks2-65"><title>Insecure WAN Boot Installation
Configuration</title><para>This security configuration requires the least administration effort,
but provides the least secure transfer of data from the web server to the
client. You do not need to create a hashing key, encryption key, or digital
certificates. You do not need to configure your web server to use HTTPS. However,
this configuration transfers the installation data and files over an HTTP
connection, which leaves your installation vulnerable to interception over
the network.</para><para>If you want the client to check the integrity of the data that is transmitted,
you can use a HMAC SHA1 hashing key with this configuration. However, the
Solaris Flash archive is not protected by the hashing key. The archive is
transferred insecurely between the server and the client during the installation.</para><para>For a list of the tasks that are required to install with this configuration,
