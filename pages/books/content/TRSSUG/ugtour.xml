</indexterm><para>Trusted Extensions offers two desktops, the Solaris Trusted Extensions (CDE) desktop and the Solaris Trusted Extensions (GNOME) desktop.
Both desktops are labeled, but the labels might not be visible when you are
working at a single label. To view an example of a system that is configured
to display labels, see <olink targetptr="ugintro-fig-12" remap="internal">Figure&nbsp;1&ndash;4</olink>.</para><para><indexterm><primary>trusted symbol</primary><secondary>on Trusted CDE  workspace</secondary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>labels</primary><secondary>visible on desktop</secondary></indexterm>A system that is configured with Trusted Extensions displays
the trusted stripe except during login and screen lock. At all other times,
the trusted stripe is visible. In Trusted CDE, the stripe is at the bottom of the
screen. In Trusted GNOME, the stripe is at the
top of the screen. The trusted symbol appears on the trusted stripe when you
interact with the trusted computing base. When you change your password, for
example, you interact with the TCB.</para><para><indexterm><primary>trusted stripe</primary><secondary>on multiheaded system</secondary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>multiheaded system</primary><secondary>trusted stripe</secondary></indexterm>When the monitors of a multiheaded Trusted Extensions system
are configured horizontally, one trusted stripe appears across the monitors.
However, if the multiheaded system is configured to display vertically, or
has  separate desktops, one per monitor, then the trusted stripe appears on
one monitor only.</para><caution><para>If a second trusted stripe appears on a multiheaded system,
the stripe is not generated by the operating system. You might have an unauthorized
program on your system. </para><para>Contact your security administrator immediately.
To determine the correct trusted stripe, see <olink targetdoc="trsoladmproc" targetptr="commontasks-48" remap="external"><citetitle remap="section">How to Regain Control of the Desktop&rsquo;s Current Focus</citetitle> in <citetitle remap="book">Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator&rsquo;s Procedures</citetitle></olink>.</para>
