<a name="ugelem-30"></a><h4>How to Change Your Password in Trusted Extensions</h4><a name="indexterm-218"></a><a name="indexterm-219"></a><a name="indexterm-220"></a><a name="indexterm-221"></a><a name="indexterm-222"></a><a name="indexterm-223"></a><a name="indexterm-224"></a><a name="indexterm-225"></a><p>Unlike the Solaris OS, Trusted Extensions provides a GUI for changing your password.
The GUI grabs the pointer until the password operation is completed. To stop
a process that has grabbed the pointer, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-7309/commontasks-48?a=view">How to Regain Control of the Desktop&rsquo;s Current Focus in <i>Solaris Trusted Extensions Administrator&rsquo;s Procedures</i></a>.</p><ol>
<li><b>Choose Change Password from the Trusted Path menu.</b><p>For the Change password menu item in Trusted GNOME, click <tt>Trusted Path</tt> in the
trusted stripe.</p><p>The following figure shows the Trusted Path menu in Trusted CDE.</p><br><img src="figures/tpmenu.gif" alt="Screen shows the basic Trusted Path menu." width="174" height="240"></img></li>
<li><b>Type your current password.</b><p>This action confirms that you are the legitimate user for this user name.
For security reasons, the password is not displayed as you type.</p>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>When you type your password, make sure that the cursor is over the
Change Password dialog box and that the trusted symbol is displayed. If the
cursor is not over the dialog box, you might inadvertently type your
password into a different window where the password could be seen by another
user. If the trusted symbol is not displayed, then someone might be attempting
to steal your password. Contact your <a href="uggloss-1.html#uggloss-82">security administrator</a> at once.</p>

<a name="ugelem-27"></a><h4>How to Allocate a Device in Trusted Extensions</h4><a name="indexterm-230"></a><a name="indexterm-231"></a><a name="indexterm-232"></a><a name="indexterm-233"></a><a name="indexterm-234"></a><a name="indexterm-235"></a><p>The Allocate Device menu item enables you to mount and allocate a
device for your exclusive use. If you try to use a device without
allocating it, you get the error message &ldquo;Permission Denied&rdquo;.</p><h6>Before You Begin</h6><p>You must be authorized to allocate a device.</p><ol>
<li><b>Choose Allocate Device from the Trusted Path menu</b><p>Or, in Trusted CDE, open the Device Allocation Manager from the Tools subpanel
in the Front Panel.</p><a name="ugelem-fig-15"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;3-5 Device Allocation Icon in Trusted CDE</h6><img src="figures/devicon.gif" alt="Screen shows the icon for the Device Allocation Manager on the Front Panel."></img><p>The Device Allocation Manager is displayed. In Solaris Trusted Extensions (GNOME), this GUI
is called the Device Manager.</p><a name="ugelem-fig-11"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;3-6 Device Allocation Manager</h6><img src="figures/devmgr.gif" alt="Screen shows the Device Allocation Manager with an audio device in the Available Devices list." width="479" height="421"></img></li>
<li><b>Double-click the device that you want to use.</b><p>The devices that you are permitted to allocate at your current label appear
under Available Devices:.</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>audio</tt><i>n</i> &ndash; Indicates a microphone and speaker</p></li>
<li><p><tt>cdrom</tt><i>n</i> &ndash; Indicates a CD-ROM drive</p></li>
<li><p><tt>floppy</tt><i>n</i> &ndash; Indicates a diskette drive</p></li>
<li><p><tt>mag_tape</tt><i>n</i> &ndash; Indicates a tape drive (streaming)</p></li>
<li><p><tt>rmdisk</tt><i>n</i> &ndash; Indicates a removable disk, such as a JAZ or ZIP drive, or USB hot-pluggable media</p></li></ul>
</li>
<li><b>Select the device.</b><p>Move the device from the Available Devices list to the Allocated Devices list.</p><ul>
<li><b>Double-click the device name in the Available Devices list.</b></li>
<li><b>Or, select the device and click the Allocate button that points to the
right.</b></li></ul><p>This step starts the clean script. The clean script ensures that no data
from other transactions remains on the media.</p><p>Note that the label of the current workspace is applied to the
device. Any data transferred to or from the device's media must be dominated
by this label.</p></li>
<li><b>Follow the instructions.</b><p>The instructions ensure that the media has the correct label. Then, the device
is mounted. The device name now appears in the Allocated Devices list. This
device is now allocated for your exclusive use.</p></li></ol><a name="managedev-14"></a><h6>Example&nbsp;3-3 Loading Removable Media to Read a File System</h6><a name="indexterm-236"></a><a name="indexterm-237"></a><a name="indexterm-238"></a><p>In this example, a user wants to load information onto her system
from a CD-ROM that is labeled <tt>SECRET</tt>. She is authorized to allocate the CD-ROM.</p><p>First, she creates a workspace at the label <tt>SECRET</tt>. In this workspace, she
opens the Device Allocation Manager, and allocates the CD-ROM drive. Then, she inserts
the CD and responds <tt>yes</tt> to the mount query.</p><p>The software mounts the CD and the File Manager appears. The current directory
is set to the mount point.</p><a name="managedev-28"></a><h6>Example&nbsp;3-4 Loading Removable Media to Format the Media</h6><a name="indexterm-239"></a><a name="indexterm-240"></a><p>In this example, a user wants to format a diskette to contain
<tt>SECRET</tt> data. She is authorized to allocate the CD-ROM drive.</p><p>First, she creates a workspace at the label <tt>SECRET</tt>. In this workspace, she
opens the Device Allocation Manager, and allocates the CD-ROM drive. Then, she inserts
the CD and responds <tt>no</tt> to the mount query. The CD can now
be formatted.</p><a name="ugtour-15"></a><h6>Example&nbsp;3-5 Allocating an Audio Device</h6><p>In this example, a user allocates the audio device on her system.
When she moves the audio device to the Allocated Device list, the following
message appears:</p><img src="figures/devmgr.micro.gif" alt="Dialog box displays warning text about microphone use." width="560" height="210"></img><p>The device is allocated at the label <tt>Confidential : Internal Use Only</tt>. She views the label
when she selects the device in the Allocated Device list.</p><img src="figures/devmgr.vislabel.gif" alt="When the audio device is selected in the Allocated Devices list, its label appears in the Label field." width="479" height="421"></img><p>When the user is finished with the audio device, she deallocates it. The
system reminds her to turn off the microphone.</p><img src="figures/devmgr.micoff.gif" alt="Dialog box displays warns user to turn off microphone." width="458" height="170"></img><h6>Troubleshooting</h6><p><a name="indexterm-241"></a><a name="indexterm-242"></a><a name="indexterm-243"></a>If the device that you want to use does not appear in the
list, check with your administrator. The device could be in an error state
or in use by someone else. Or, you might not be authorized to
use the device.</p><p>If you switch to a different role workspace or to a workspace
at a different label, the allocated device cannot work at that label. To
use the device at the new label, you need to deallocate the device
at the initial label, and then allocate the device at the new label.
In Trusted CDE, when you use the Occupy Workspace command from the window
menu to move the Device Allocation Manager to the new workspace, the Available
and Allocated Devices lists change to reflect the correct context. The Device Manager
in Trusted GNOME works similarly when you move the GUI to a workspace
at a different label.</p><p><a name="indexterm-244"></a><a name="indexterm-245"></a><a name="indexterm-246"></a>If a File Manager or File Browser window does not appear, open the
window manually, then navigate to the root directory, <tt>/</tt>. In this directory,
navigate to the allocated device to see its contents.</p>

<a name="ugtour-12"></a><h4>How to Deallocate a Device in Trusted Extensions</h4><a name="indexterm-247"></a><a name="indexterm-248"></a><ol>
<li><b>Deallocate the device.</b><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
				 
<li><b>Go to the workspace where the Device Allocation Manager is displayed.</b></li>
<li><b>Move the device to be deallocated from the list of allocated devices.</b></li></ol></li>
<li><b>Remove the media.</b></li>
<li><b>Click OK in the Deallocation dialog box.</b><p>The device is now available for use by another authorized user.</p></li></ol>

<a name="ugelem-34"></a><h4>How to Assume a Role in Trusted Extensions</h4><a name="indexterm-249"></a><a name="indexterm-250"></a><a name="indexterm-251"></a><a name="indexterm-252"></a><p>Unlike the Solaris OS, Trusted Extensions provides a GUI for assuming a
role.</p><ol>
<li><b><a name="indexterm-253"></a>Open the Trusted Path menu.</b><ul>
<li><b>In Solaris Trusted Extensions (CDE), click the center of the Front Panel.</b><p>If you have been assigned a role by the security administrator, the Trusted
Path menu includes the Assume <i>rolename</i> Role menu item.</p><p>Choose Assume <i>rolename</i> Role.</p></li>
<li><b>In Solaris Trusted Extensions (GNOME), click your user name at the right of
the trusted symbol.</b><p>Choose the role name from the menu.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Type the role password and press Return.</b><p>This action confirms that you can legitimately assume this role. For security reasons, the
password is not displayed as you type.</p>
<hr><p><b>Caution - </b>When you type your password, make sure that the cursor is over the
Change Password dialog box and that the trusted symbol is displayed. If the
cursor is not over the dialog box, you might inadvertently type your
password into a different window where the password could be seen by another
user. If the trusted symbol is not displayed, then someone might be attempting
to steal your password. Contact your <a href="uggloss-1.html#uggloss-82">security administrator</a> at once.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the role password is accepted, the software places you in a
role workspace. In Trusted GNOME, the current workspace becomes the role workspace. In Trusted
CDE, a new workspace is created for the role. You are in the
global zone. You can perform the tasks that are permitted by the rights
profiles in your role.</p></li></ol>

of working at different labels within the same session. On both desktops,&nbsp;you can
add a workspace at your minimum label. In Trusted CDE, you can
add a workspace at the label of an existing workspace.</p>
<hr><p><b>Tip - </b>In Trusted CDE, rename each workspace button to reflect the label of the
workspace.</p>
<hr>
<p>To change the label of the current workspace, see <a href="#shared-commontasks-39">How to Change the Label of a Workspace</a>.</p><h6>Before You Begin</h6><p>You must be logged in to a multilevel session.</p><ol>

<a name="ugtour-17"></a><h4>How to Move a Window to a Different Workspace</h4><a name="indexterm-265"></a><a name="indexterm-266"></a><p>Windows that are moved to a different workspace retain their original label. Any
actions that are done in those windows are done at the label
of the window, not at the label of the containing workspace. Moving a
window is useful when you want to compare information. You might also want
to use applications at different labels without moving between workspaces.</p><ol>
<li><b>In Trusted CDE, use the Occupy Workspace menu to move a window
to a different workspace.</b><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
				 
<li><a name="ugtour-step-1"></a><b>From the application's window menu, choose Occupy Workspace.</b><a name="ugtour-fig-5"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;3-8 Selecting Occupy Workspace</h6><img src="figures/OccupyWksp.gif" alt="Screen shows the Occupy Workspace dialog box." width="297" height="346"></img></li>
<li><a name="ugtour-step-2"></a><b>Choose a workspace at a different label, then click OK.</b><p>This action moves the application to a workspace that has  a different
label. Note that the Occupy Workspace dialog box has the label Trusted Path.
This label indicates that occupying a workspace affects the trusted computing base.</p><p>The following figure shows two terminal windows at different labels in one workspace.</p><a name="ugtour-fig-12"></a><h6>Figure&nbsp;3-9 Differently Labeled Windows in One Workspace</h6><img src="figures/win2label.gif" alt="Screen shows a Public window and a Confidential window in one workspace." width="904" height="272"></img></li></ol></li>
<li><b>In Trusted GNOME, in the panel display, drag the window from its original
workspace box to a different workspace box.</b><p>The dragged window now appears in the second workspace.</p></li></ol>

<a name="txwork-10"></a><h4>How to Determine the Label of a File</h4><a name="indexterm-267"></a><a name="indexterm-268"></a><a name="indexterm-269"></a><p>Usually, the label of a file is obvious. However, if you are
allowed to view files at a lower label than your current workspace, the
label of a file might not be obvious. In particular, the label of
a file can be different from the label of the File Manager.</p><ol>
<li><b>In Trusted CDE, use the File Manager to determine the label of
the file.</b><ul>
<li><b>In the File Manager, select the file, then choose the File -&gt; Properties
menu item.</b><p>Read the value of the file's Sensitivity Label property.</p></li>
<li><b>Or, drag the file from the containing File Manager onto the desktop.</b><p>The file icon displays the label of the file.</p></li></ul></li>
<li><b><a name="indexterm-270"></a>In Trusted GNOME, use the File Browser.</b>
<hr><p><b>Tip - </b>You can also use the Query Label menu item from the Trusted
Path menu.</p>
