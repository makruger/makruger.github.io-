<a name="gld-overview"></a><h3>Generic LAN Driver Overview</h3>
<p><a name="indexterm-674"></a>GLD is a multi-threaded, clonable, loadable kernel module providing support to device drivers
for local area networks. Local area network (LAN) device drivers in the Solaris
OS are STREAMS-based drivers that use DLPI to communicate with network protocol stacks.
These protocol stacks use the network drivers to send and receive packets on
a local area network.</p><p>A network device driver must implement and conform to these requirements:</p>
<ul><li><p>DDI/DKI specification</p></li>
<li><p>STREAMS specification</p></li>
<li><p>DLPI specification</p></li>
<li><p>programmatic interface for the device</p></li></ul>
<p>GLD implements most STREAMS and DLPI functionality required of a Solaris LAN driver.
Several Solaris network drivers are implemented using GLD.</p><p><a name="indexterm-675"></a><a name="indexterm-676"></a><a name="indexterm-677"></a><a name="indexterm-678"></a>A Solaris network driver that is implemented using GLD is made up of
two distinct parts: a generic component that deals with STREAMS and DLPI interfaces,
and a device-specific component that deals with the particular hardware device. The device-specific
module indicates its dependency on the GLD module, which is found at <tt>/kernel/misc/gld</tt>.
The device-specific module then registers with GLD from within the driver's <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2255/attach-9e?a=view"><tt>attach</tt>(9E)</a> function. After
the device-specific module is successfully loaded, the driver is DLPI-compliant.  The device-specific
part of the driver calls <tt>gld</tt>(9F) functions when that part receives data or
needs some service from GLD. When the device-specific driver registers with the GLD,
the driver provides pointers to the entry points for later use by GLD.
GLD makes calls into the <tt>gld</tt>(9E) using these pointers.  The <tt>gld_mac_info</tt>(9S)
structure is the main data interface between GLD and the device-specific driver.</p><p>The GLD facility currently supports the following types of devices:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>DL_ETHER</tt>, that is, ISO 8802-3, IEEE 802.3 protocol</p></li>
<li><p><tt>DL_TPR</tt>, that is, IEEE 802.5, Token Passing Ring</p></li>
<li><p><tt>DL_FDDI</tt>, that is, ISO 9314-2, Fibre Distributed Data Interface</p></li></ul>
<p><a name="indexterm-679"></a><a name="indexterm-680"></a><a name="indexterm-681"></a><a name="indexterm-682"></a><a name="indexterm-683"></a><a name="indexterm-684"></a><a name="indexterm-685"></a><a name="indexterm-686"></a>GLD drivers are expected to process fully formed MAC-layer packets and should not perform
logical link control (LLC) handling.</p><p>In some cases, a full DLPI-compliant driver can be implemented without using the
GLD facility. One case would be devices that are not ISO 8802-style, that
is, IEEE 802, LAN devices. Another case would be devices or services that
are not supported by GLD.</p>

<a name="gld-dlether"></a><h4>Type <tt>DL_ETHER</tt>: Ethernet V2 and ISO 8802-3 (IEEE 802.3)</h4>
<a name="indexterm-687"></a><a name="indexterm-688"></a><a name="indexterm-689"></a><a name="indexterm-690"></a><a name="indexterm-691"></a><p><a name="indexterm-692"></a>For devices designated type <tt>DL_ETHER</tt>, GLD provides support for both Ethernet V2 and
ISO 8802-3 (IEEE 802.3) packet processing. Ethernet V2 enables a user to access
a conforming provider of data link services without special knowledge of the provider's
protocol. A service access point (SAP) is the point through which the user
communicates with the service provider.</p><p>Streams bound to SAP values in the range [0-255] are treated as equivalent
and denote that the user wants to use 8802-3 mode. If the SAP
value of the <tt>DL_BIND_REQ</tt> is within this range, GLD computes the length of
each subsequent <tt>DL_UNITDATA_REQ</tt> message on that stream. The length does not include
the 14-byte media access control (MAC) header. GLD then transmits 8802-3 frames that have
those lengths in the MAC frame header <tt>type</tt> fields. Such lengths never
exceed 1500.</p><p>All frames that are received from the media that have a <tt>type</tt>
field in the range [0-1500] are assumed to be 8802-3 frames. These frames
are routed up all open streams in 8802-3 mode. Those streams with SAP
values in the [0-255] range are considered to be in 8802-3 mode. If
more than one stream is in 8802-3 mode, the incoming frame is duplicated
and routed up these streams.</p><p>Those streams that are bound to SAP values that are greater than 1500
are assumed to be in Ethernet V2 mode. These streams receive incoming packets
whose Ethernet MAC header <tt>type</tt> value exactly matches the value of the SAP
to which the stream is bound.</p>

<a name="gld-snap"></a><h4>Types <tt>DL_TPR</tt> and <tt>DL_FDDI</tt>: SNAP Processing</h4>
<a name="indexterm-693"></a><a name="indexterm-694"></a><a name="indexterm-695"></a><a name="indexterm-696"></a><p><a name="indexterm-697"></a><a name="indexterm-698"></a><a name="indexterm-699"></a>For media types <tt>DL_TPR</tt> and <tt>DL_FDDI</tt>, GLD implements minimal SNAP (Sub-Net Access Protocol)
processing. This processing is for any stream that is bound to a SAP
value that is greater than 255. SAP values in the range [0-255] are LLC
SAP values. Such values are carried naturally by the media packet format. SAP
values that are greater than 255 require a SNAP header, subordinate to the
LLC header, to carry the 16-bit Ethernet V2-style SAP value.</p><p>SNAP headers are carried under LLC headers with destination SAP 0xAA. Outbound
packets with SAP values that are greater than 255 require an LLC+SNAP header
take the following form:</p><pre>AA AA 03 00 00 00 XX XX</pre><p>``XX XX'' represents the 16-bit SAP, corresponding to the Ethernet V2 style ``type.''
This header is unique in supporting non-zero  organizational unique identifier fields. LLC
control fields other than 03 are considered to be LLC packets with SAP
0xAA. Clients wanting to use SNAP formats other than this format must use LLC
and bind to SAP 0xAA.</p><p>Incoming packets are checked for conformance with the above format. Packets that conform
are matched to any streams that have been bound to the packet's 16-bit
SNAP type. In addition, these packets are  considered to match the LLC
SNAP  SAP 0xAA.</p><p>Packets received for any LLC SAP are passed up all streams that are
bound to an LLC SAP, as described for media type <tt>DL_ETHER</tt>.</p>

<a name="gld-dltpr"></a><h4>Type <tt>DL_TPR</tt>: Source Routing</h4>
<a name="indexterm-700"></a><a name="indexterm-701"></a><p>For type <tt>DL_TPR</tt> devices, GLD implements minimal support for source routing. Source routing
support includes the following items:</p>
<ul><li><p>Specify routing information for a packet to be sent across a bridged medium. The routing information is stored in the MAC header. This information is used to determine the route.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn routes.</p></li>
<li><p>Solicit and respond to requests for information about possible multiple routes</p></li>
<li><p>Select among available routes.</p></li></ul>
<p>Source routing adds routing information fields to the MAC headers of outgoing packets.
In addition, this support recognizes such fields in incoming packets.</p><p>GLD's source routing support does not implement the full route determination entity (RDE)
specified in Section 9 of <i>ISO 8802-2 (IEEE 802.2)</i>. However, this support can interoperate with any
RDE implementations that might exist in the same or a bridged network.</p>

<a name="gld-style"></a><h4>Style 1 and Style 2 DLPI Providers</h4>
<a name="indexterm-702"></a><a name="indexterm-703"></a><a name="indexterm-704"></a><p><a name="indexterm-705"></a><a name="indexterm-706"></a>GLD implements both Style 1 and Style 2 DLPI providers. A physical point
of attachment (PPA) is the point at which a system attaches itself to
a physical communication medium. All communication on that physical medium funnels through the
PPA. The Style 1 provider attaches the streams to a particular PPA based
on the major or minor device that has been opened. The Style 2
provider requires the DLS, that is, the data link service, user to
explicitly identify the desired PPA using <tt>DL_ATTACH_REQ</tt>. In this case, <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2255/open-9e?a=view"><tt>open</tt>(9E)</a> creates a stream between
the user and GLD, and <tt>DL_ATTACH_REQ</tt> subsequently associates a particular PPA with that
stream. Style 2 is denoted by a minor number of zero. If a
device node whose minor number is not zero is opened, Style 1 is
indicated and the associated PPA is the minor number minus 1. In both
Style 1 and Style 2 <tt>open</tt>s, the device is cloned.</p>

<a name="gld-dlpi"></a><h4>Implemented DLPI Primitives</h4>
<a name="indexterm-707"></a><p><a name="indexterm-708"></a><a name="indexterm-709"></a>GLD implements several DLPI primitives. The <tt>DL_INFO_REQ</tt> primitive requests information about the DLPI streams.
The message consists of one <tt>M_PROTO</tt> message block. GLD returns device-dependent values in
the <tt>DL_INFO_ACK</tt> response to this request. These values are based on information that
 the GLD-based driver specified in the <tt>gldm_mac_info</tt>(9S) structure that was passed to
<tt>gld_register()</tt>.</p><p>GLD returns the following values on behalf of all GLD-based drivers:</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-710"></a><a name="indexterm-711"></a>Version is <tt>DL_VERSION_2</tt></p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-712"></a><a name="indexterm-713"></a>Service mode is <tt>DL_CLDLS</tt>, GLD implements connectionless-mode service.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-714"></a><a name="indexterm-715"></a><a name="indexterm-716"></a><a name="indexterm-717"></a>Provider style is <tt>DL_STYLE1</tt> or <tt>DL_STYLE2</tt>, depending on how the stream was opened.</p></li>
<li><p>No optional Quality of Service (QOS) support is present. The QOS fields are zero.</p></li></ul>

<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Contrary to the DLPI specification, GLD returns the device's correct address length and
broadcast address in <tt>DL_INFO_ACK</tt> even before the stream has been attached to a
PPA.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="indexterm-718"></a><a name="indexterm-719"></a>The <tt>DL_ATTACH_REQ</tt> primitive is used to associate a PPA with a stream. This
request is needed for Style 2 DLS providers to identify the physical medium
over which the communication is sent. Upon completion, the state changes from <tt>DL_UNATTACHED</tt>
to <tt>DL_UNBOUND</tt>. The message consists of one <tt>M_PROTO</tt> message block. This request is not
allowed when Style 1 mode is used. Streams that are opened using Style
1 are already attached to a PPA by the time the open completes.</p><p><a name="indexterm-720"></a><a name="indexterm-721"></a>The <tt>DL_DETACH_REQ</tt> primitive requests to detach the PPA from the stream. This detachment
is allowed only if the stream was opened using Style 2.</p><p><a name="indexterm-722"></a><a name="indexterm-723"></a><a name="indexterm-724"></a><a name="indexterm-725"></a>The <tt>DL_BIND_REQ</tt> and <tt>DL_UNBIND_REQ</tt> primitives bind and unbind a DLSAP (data link service
access point) to the stream. The PPA that is associated with a stream
completes initialization before the completion of the processing of the <tt>DL_BIND_REQ</tt> on that
stream. You can bind multiple streams to the same SAP. Each stream in this
case receives a copy of any packets that were received for that
SAP.</p><p><a name="indexterm-726"></a><a name="indexterm-727"></a><a name="indexterm-728"></a><a name="indexterm-729"></a>The <tt>DL_ENABMULTI_REQ</tt> and <tt>DL_DISABMULTI_REQ</tt> primitives enable and disable reception of individual multicast group
addresses. Through iterative use of these primitives, an application or other DLS user
can create or modify a set of multicast addresses. The streams must be
attached to a PPA for these primitives to be accepted.</p><p><a name="indexterm-730"></a><a name="indexterm-731"></a><a name="indexterm-732"></a><a name="indexterm-733"></a>The <tt>DL_PROMISCON_REQ</tt> and <tt>DL_PROMISCOFF_REQ</tt> primitives turn promiscuous mode on or off on a
per-stream basis. These controls operate at either at a physical level or at
the SAP level. The DL Provider routes all received messages on the media
to the DLS user. Routing continues until a <tt>DL_DETACH_REQ</tt> is received, a <tt>DL_PROMISCOFF_REQ</tt>
is received, or the stream is closed. You can specify physical level promiscuous
reception of all packets on the medium or of multicast packets only.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The streams must be attached to a PPA for these promiscuous mode primitives
to be accepted.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="indexterm-734"></a>The <tt>DL_UNITDATA_REQ</tt> primitive is used to send data in a connectionless transfer. Because
this service is not acknowledged, delivery is not guaranteed. The message consists of
one <tt>M_PROTO</tt> message block followed by one or more <tt>M_DATA</tt> blocks containing at
least one byte of data.</p><p><a name="indexterm-735"></a>The <tt>DL_UNITDATA_IND</tt> type is used when a packet is to be passed on
upstream. The packet is put into an <tt>M_PROTO</tt> message with the primitive set
to <tt>DL_UNITDATA_IND</tt>.</p><p><a name="indexterm-736"></a><a name="indexterm-737"></a>The <tt>DL_PHYS_ADDR_REQ</tt> primitive requests the MAC address currently associated with the PPA attached
to the streams. The address is returned by the <tt>DL_PHYS_ADDR_ACK</tt> primitive. When using Style
2, this primitive is only valid following a successful <tt>DL_ATTACH_REQ</tt>.</p><p><a name="indexterm-738"></a><a name="indexterm-739"></a>The <tt>DL_SET_PHYS_ADDR_REQ</tt> primitive changes the MAC address currently associated with the PPA attached
to the streams. This primitive affects all other current and future streams attached
to this device. Once changed, all streams currently or subsequently opened and attached to
this device  obtain this new physical address. The new physical address remains
in effect until this primitive changes the physical address again or the driver
is reloaded.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The superuser is allowed to change the physical address of a PPA
while other streams are bound to the same PPA.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="indexterm-740"></a><a name="indexterm-741"></a><a name="indexterm-742"></a><a name="indexterm-743"></a>The <tt>DL_GET_STATISTICS_REQ</tt> primitive requests a <tt>DL_GET_STATISTICS_ACK</tt> response containing statistics information associated with the PPA
attached to the stream. Style 2 Streams must be attached to a particular
PPA using <tt>DL_ATTACH_REQ</tt> before this primitive can succeed.</p>

<a name="gld-ioctl"></a><h4>Implemented <tt>ioctl</tt> Functions</h4>
<a name="indexterm-744"></a><p>GLD implements the <tt>ioctl</tt> <i>ioc_cmd</i> function described below. If GLD receives an unrecognizable
<tt>ioctl</tt> command, GLD passes the command to the device-specific driver's <tt>gldm_ioctl()</tt> routine, as described
in <tt>gld</tt>(9E).</p><p><a name="indexterm-745"></a><a name="indexterm-746"></a><a name="indexterm-747"></a>The <tt>DLIOCRAW</tt> <tt>ioctl</tt> function is used by some DLPI applications, most notably the
<tt>snoop</tt>(1M) command. The <tt>DLIOCRAW</tt> command puts the stream into a raw mode. In raw
mode, the driver passes full MAC-level incoming packets upstream in <tt>M_DATA</tt> messages instead
of transforming the packets into the <tt>DL_UNITDATA_IND</tt> form. The <tt>DL_UNITDATA_IND</tt> form is normally
used for reporting incoming packets. Packet SAP filtering is still performed on
streams that are in raw mode. If a stream user wants to receive
all incoming packets, the user must also select the appropriate promiscuous modes. After
successfully selecting raw mode, the application is also allowed to send fully formatted
packets to the driver as <tt>M_DATA</tt> messages for transmission. <tt>DLIOCRAW</tt> takes no arguments. Once
enabled, the stream remains in this mode until closed.</p>

<a name="gld-reqts"></a><h4>GLD Driver Requirements</h4>
<p>GLD-based drivers must include the header file <tt>&lt;sys/gld.h&gt;</tt>.</p><p>GLD-based drivers must be linked with the <tt>-N</tt><i>&ldquo;misc/gld&rdquo;</i> option:</p><pre>%ld -r -N"misc/gld" xx.o -o xx</pre><p>GLD implements the following functions on behalf of the device-specific driver:</p>

<tt>attach()</tt> then prepares the device and driver for use.</p><p><a name="indexterm-749"></a><a name="indexterm-750"></a>The <tt>attach</tt>(9E) function allocates a <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2257/gld-mac-info-9s?a=view"><tt>gld_mac_info</tt>(9S)</a> structure using <tt>gld_mac_alloc()</tt>. The driver usually needs to
save more information per device than is defined in the <tt>macinfo</tt> structure. The
driver should allocate the additional required data structure and save a pointer to
the structure in the <tt>gldm_private</tt> member of the <tt>gld_mac_info</tt>(9S) structure.</p><p>The <tt>attach</tt>(9E) routine must initialize the <tt>macinfo</tt> structure as described in the <tt>gld_mac_info</tt>(9S)
man page. The <tt>attach()</tt> routine should then call <tt>gld_register()</tt> to link the driver
with the GLD module. The driver should map registers if necessary and be
fully initialized and prepared to accept interrupts before calling <tt>gld_register()</tt>. The <tt>attach</tt>(9E) function
should add interrupts but should not enable the device to generate these interrupts.
The driver should reset the hardware before calling <tt>gld_register()</tt> to ensure the hardware is
quiescent. A device must not be put into a state where the
device might generate an interrupt before <tt>gld_register()</tt> is called. The device is started 
later when GLD calls the driver's <tt>gldm_start()</tt> entry point, which is described in
the <tt>gld</tt>(9E) man page. After <tt>gld_register()</tt> succeeds, the <tt>gld</tt>(9E) entry points might be
called by GLD at any time.</p><p>The <tt>attach</tt>(9E) routine should return <tt>DDI_SUCCESS</tt> if <tt>gld_register()</tt> succeeds. If <tt>gld_register()</tt> fails,
<tt>DDI_FAILURE</tt> is returned. If a failure occurs, the <tt>attach</tt>(9E) routine should deallocate any
resources that were allocated before  <tt>gld_register()</tt> was called. The attach routine
should then also return <tt>DDI_FAILURE</tt>. A failed <tt>macinfo</tt> structure should never be reused.
Such a structure should be deallocated using <tt>gld_mac_free()</tt>.</p><p><a name="indexterm-751"></a><a name="indexterm-752"></a>The <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2255/detach-9e?a=view"><tt>detach</tt>(9E)</a>function should attempt to unregister the driver from GLD by calling <tt>gld_unregister()</tt>. For
more information about <tt>gld_unregister()</tt>, see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2256/gld-9f?a=view"><tt>gld</tt>(9F)</a> man page. The <tt>detach</tt>(9E) routine can
get a pointer to the needed <tt>gld_mac_info</tt>(9S) structure from the device's private data
using <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2256/ddi-get-driver-private-9f?a=view"><tt>ddi_get_driver_private</tt>(9F)</a>. <tt>gld_unregister()</tt> checks certain conditions that could require that the driver not
be detached. If the checks fail, <tt>gld_unregister()</tt> returns <tt>DDI_FAILURE</tt>, in which case the driver's
<tt>detach</tt>(9E) routine must leave the device operational and return <tt>DDI_FAILURE</tt>.</p><p>If the checks succeed, <tt>gld_unregister()</tt> ensures that the device interrupts are stopped. The
driver's <tt>gldm_stop()</tt> routine is called if necessary. The driver is unlinked from the
GLD framework. <tt>gld_unregister()</tt> then returns <tt>DDI_SUCCESS</tt>. In this case, the <tt>detach</tt>(9E) routine should
remove interrupts and use <tt>gld_mac_free()</tt> to deallocate any <tt>macinfo</tt> data structures that were allocated
in the <tt>attach</tt>(9E) routine. The <tt>detach()</tt> routine should then return <tt>DDI_SUCCESS</tt>. The routine
must remove the interrupt <i>before</i> calling <tt>gld_mac_free()</tt>.</p>

<a name="gld-netstats"></a><h4>Network Statistics</h4>
<a name="indexterm-753"></a><p><a name="indexterm-754"></a><a name="indexterm-755"></a><a name="indexterm-756"></a>Solaris network drivers must implement statistics variables. GLD tallies some network statistics, but other
statistics must be counted by each GLD-based driver. GLD provides support for GLD-based
drivers to report a standard set of network driver statistics. Statistics are reported
by GLD using the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2254/kstat-7d?a=view"><tt>kstat</tt>(7D)</a> and <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-2257/kstat-9s?a=view"><tt>kstat</tt>(9S)</a> mechanisms. The <tt>DL_GET_STATISTICS_REQ</tt> DLPI command
can also be used to retrieve the current statistics counters. All statistics are
maintained as unsigned. The statistics are 32 bits unless otherwise noted.</p><p>GLD maintains and reports the following statistics.</p><dl><dt><tt>rbytes64</tt></dt>
