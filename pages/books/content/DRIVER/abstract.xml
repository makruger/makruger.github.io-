<?Pub CX book(title()bookinfo(authorgroup()pubsnumber()releaseinfo()pubdate()publisher()copyright()abstract(?><para><citetitle>Writing Device Drivers</citetitle> provides information on developing
drivers for character-oriented devices, block-oriented devices, network devices,
SCSI target and HBA devices, and USB devices for the <trademark>Solaris</trademark> Operating
System (Solaris OS). This book discusses how to develop multithreaded reentrant
device drivers for all architectures that conform to the Solaris OS DDI/DKI
(Device Driver Interface, Driver-Kernel Interface). A common driver programming
approach is described that enables drivers to be written without concern for
platform-specific issues such as endianness and data ordering.</para><para>Additional topics include hardening Solaris drivers; power management;
driver autoconfiguration; programmed I/O; Direct Memory Access (DMA); device
context management; compilation, installation, and testing drivers; debugging
drivers; and porting Solaris drivers to a 64-bit environment.</para><?Pub *0000001138 0?>
