             <a name="glossary-1"></a><h3>Glossary</h3><a name="glossary-2"></a><b>accreditation range</b><p>A set of sensitivity labels that are approved for a class of users
or resources. A set of valid <a href="#glossary-66">label</a>s. See also <a href="#glossary-123">system accreditation range</a> and <a href="#glossary-138">user accreditation range</a>.</p><a name="glossary-5"></a><b>administrative role</b><p>A <a href="#glossary-104">role</a> that gives required <a href="#glossary-9">authorization</a>s, privileged commands, privileged actions, and the
Trusted Path <a href="#glossary-112">security attribute</a> to allow the role to perform administrative tasks. Roles perform
a subset of Solaris superuser's capabilities, such as backup or auditing.</p><a name="glossary-7"></a><b>allocation</b><p>A mechanism by which access to a <a href="#glossary-28">device</a> is controlled. See <a href="#glossary-29">device allocation</a>.</p><a name="glossary-10"></a><b>application search path</b><p>In <a href="#glossary-15">CDE</a>, the search path is used by the <a href="#glossary-124">system</a> to find applications and
certain configuration information. The application search path is controlled by a <a href="#glossary-131">trusted role</a>.</p><a name="glossary-9"></a><b>authorization</b><p>A right granted to a user or role to perform an action
that would otherwise not be allowed by security policy. Authorizations are granted in <a href="#glossary-54">rights profile</a>s.
Certain commands require the user to have certain authorizations to succeed. For example,
to print a PostScript file requires the Print Postscript authorization.</p><a name="glossary-15"></a><b>CDE</b><p>See <a href="#glossary-21">Common Desktop Environment</a>.</p><a name="glossary-91"></a><b>CIPSO label</b><p>Common IP Security Option. CIPSO is the label standard that Trusted Extensions
implements.</p><a name="glossary-16"></a><b>clearance</b><p>The upper limit of the set of labels at which a user
can work. The lower limit is the <a href="#glossary-78">minimum label</a> that is assigned by the <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a>. A
clearance can be one of two types, a session clearance or a
<a href="#glossary-139">user clearance</a>.</p><a name="glossary-17"></a><b>client</b><p>A system connected to a network.</p><a name="glossary-18"></a><b>closed network</b><p>A network of systems that are configured with Trusted Extensions. The network is
cut off from any non-Trusted Extensions host. The cutoff can be physical, where
no wire extends past the Trusted Extensions network. The cutoff can be in
the software, where the Trusted Extensions hosts recognize only Trusted Extensions hosts. Data
entry from outside the network is restricted to peripherals attached to Trusted Extensions
hosts. Contrast with <a href="#glossary-90">open network</a>.</p><a name="glossary-21"></a><b>Common Desktop Environment</b><p>The historical windowing environment for administering Trusted Extensions software. Trusted Extensions modifies the
environment to create Trusted CDE. The Sun Java<sup>TM</sup> Desktop System is also
modified to create a Trusted JDS.</p><a name="glossary-22"></a><b>.copy_files file</b><p>An optional setup file on a multilabel system. This file contains a list
of startup files, such as <tt>.cshrc</tt> or <tt>.mozilla</tt>, that the user environment
or user applications require in order for the system or application to behave
well. The files that are listed in <tt>.copy_files</tt> are then <b>copied</b> to
the user's home directory at higher labels, when those directories are created. See
also <a href="#glossary-72">.link_files file</a>.</p><a name="glossary-26"></a><b>DAC</b><p>See <a href="#glossary-31">discretionary access control</a>.</p><a name="glossary-28"></a><b>device</b><p>Devices include printers, computers, tape drives, floppy drives, CD-ROM drives, DVD drives, audio
devices, and internal pseudo terminal devices. Devices are subject to the read equal
write equal <a href="#glossary-74">MAC</a> policy. Access to removable devices, such as DVD drives,
are controlled by<a href="#glossary-29">device allocation</a>.</p><a name="glossary-29"></a><b>device allocation</b><p>A mechanism for protecting the information on an allocatable <a href="#glossary-28">device</a> from access
by anybody except the user who allocates the device. Until a device is
deallocated, no one but the user who allocated a device can access any
information that is associated with the device. For a user to allocate a
device, that user must have been granted the Device Allocation authorization by the
<a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a>.</p><a name="glossary-31"></a><b>discretionary access control</b><p>The type of access that is granted or that is denied by
the owner of a file or directory at the discretion of the owner.
Solaris Trusted Extensions provides two kinds of discretionary access controls (DAC), UNIX <a href="#glossary-96">permission bits</a>
and ACLs.</p><a name="glossary-34"></a><b>domain</b><p>A part of the Internet naming hierarchy. It represents a group of <a href="#glossary-124">system</a>s
on a local network that share administrative files.</p><a name="glossary-36"></a><b>domain name</b><p>The identification of a group of <a href="#glossary-124">system</a>s on a local network. A
domain name consists of a sequence of component names separated by periods (for
example: <tt>example1.town.state.country.org</tt>). As you read a domain name from left to right,
the component names identify more general, and usually remote, areas of administrative authority.</p><a name="glossary-42"></a><b>evaluated configuration</b><p>One or more Trusted Extensions hosts that are running in a configuration that
has been certified as meeting specific criteria by a certification authority. In the
United States, those criteria are the TCSEC. The evaluating and certifying body is
the NSA. Solaris Trusted Extensions software will be certified to the Common
Criteria v2.1 [August 1999], an ISO standard, to Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4, and
against a number of protection profiles.</p><p>The Common Criteria v2 (CCv2) and protection profiles make the earlier TCSEC U.S.
standard obsolete through level B1+. A mutual recognition agreement for CCv2 has been
signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, and
France.</p><p>The Trusted Extensions configuration target provides functionality that is similar to the TCSEC
C2 and B1 levels, with some additional functionality.</p><a name="glossary-48"></a><b>file system</b><p>A collection of files and directories that, when set into a logical hierarchy,
make up an organized, structured set of information. File systems can be mounted
from your local <a href="#glossary-124">system</a> or a remote system.</p><a name="glossary-51"></a><b>GFI</b><p>Government Furnished Information. In this manual, it refers to a U.S. government-provided <a href="#glossary-69">label_encodings file</a>.
In order to use a GFI with Trusted Extensions software, you must add
the Sun-specific <tt>LOCAL DEFINITIONS</tt> section to the end of the GFI. For details, see
<a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-7308/localdef-1?a=view">Chapter 5, Customizing LOCAL DEFINITIONS, in <i>Solaris Trusted Extensions Label Administration</i></a>.</p><a name="glossary-52"></a><b>host name</b><p>The name by which a <a href="#glossary-124">system</a> is known to other systems on a
network. This name must be unique among all the <a href="#glossary-124">system</a>s within a
given domain. Usually, a domain identifies a  single organization. A host name
can be any combination of letters, numbers, and minus sign (&minus;), but it
cannot begin or end with a minus sign.</p><a name="glossary-56"></a><b>initial label</b><p>The <a href="#glossary-78">minimum label</a> assigned to a user or role, and the label of the
user's initial workspace. The initial label is the lowest label at which the
user or role can work.</p><a name="glossary-59"></a><b>install team</b><p>A team of at least two people who together oversee the installation and
configuration of Solaris Trusted Extensions software. One team member is responsible for security
decisions, and the other for system administration decisions.</p><a name="glossary-61"></a><b>IP address</b><p>Internet protocol address. A unique number that identifies a networked system so it
can communicate by means of Internet protocols. In IPv4, the address consists of
four numbers separated by periods. Most often, each part of the IP address
is a number between 0 and 225. However, the first number must be
less than 224 and the last number cannot be 0.</p><p>IP addresses are logically divided into two parts: the network, and the <a href="#glossary-124">system</a>
on the network. The network number is similar to a telephone area code.
In relation to the network, the system number is similar to a phone
number.</p><a name="glossary-66"></a><b>label</b><p>A security identifier that is assigned to an object. The label is based
on the level at which the information in that object should be
protected. Depending on how the <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a> has configured the user, a user can see
the <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a>, or no labels at all. Labels are defined in the
<a href="#glossary-69">label_encodings file</a>.</p><a name="glossary-67"></a><b>label configuration</b><p>A Trusted Extensions installation choice of single-label or multilabel sensitivity labels. In most
circumstances, label configuration is identical on all systems at your site.</p><a name="glossary-69"></a><b>label_encodings file</b><p>The file where the complete <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a> is defined, as are accreditation ranges,
label view, default label visibility, default user clearance, and other aspects of labels.</p><a name="glossary-70"></a><b>label range</b><p>A set of <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a>s that are assigned to commands, zones, and allocatable <a href="#glossary-28">device</a>s.
The range is specified by designating a maximum label and a minimum label.
For commands, the minimum and maximum labels limit the labels at which the
command can be executed. Remote hosts that do not recognize labels are assigned
a single <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a>, as are any other hosts that the <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a> wants to restrict
to a single label. A label range limits the labels at which
devices can be allocated and restrict the labels at which information can be
stored or processed when using the device.</p><a name="glossary-98"></a><b>label set</b><p>See <a href="#glossary-24">security label set</a>.</p><a name="glossary-68"></a><b>labeled host</b><p>A labeled host sends network packets that are labeled with <a href="#glossary-91">CIPSO label</a>s. All
Trusted Extensions hosts are labeled hosts.</p><a name="glossary-72"></a><b>.link_files file</b><p>An optional setup file on a multilabel system. This file contains a list
of startup files, such as <tt>.cshrc</tt> or <tt>.mozilla</tt>, that the user environment
or user applications require in order for the system or application to behave
well. The files that are listed in <tt>.link_files</tt> are then <b>linked</b> to
the user's home directory at higher labels, when those directories are created. See
also <a href="#glossary-22">.copy_files file</a>.</p><a name="glossary-74"></a><b>MAC</b><p>See <a href="#glossary-75">mandatory access control</a>.</p><a name="glossary-75"></a><b>mandatory access control</b><p>Access control that is based on comparing the <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a> of a file,
directory, or <a href="#glossary-28">device</a> to the sensitivity label of the process that is trying
to access it. The <a href="#glossary-74">MAC</a> rule, read equal&ndash;read down, applies when a process
at one label attempts to read a file at a lower label. The
MAC rule, write equal-read down, applies when a process at one label attempts
to write to a directory at another label.</p><a name="glossary-78"></a><b>minimum label</b><p>The lower bound of a user's <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a>s and the lower bound of
the system's sensitivity labels. The minimum label set by the <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a> when specifying a
user's <a href="#glossary-112">security attribute</a>s is the sensitivity label of the user's first workspace at first
login. The sensitivity label that is specified in the minimum label field by
the <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a> in the <tt>label_encodings</tt>  file sets the lower bound for
the system.</p><a name="glossary-84"></a><b>naming service</b><p>A distributed network database that contains key system information about all the <a href="#glossary-124">system</a>s
on a network, so that the systems can communicate with each other. With
a naming service, the system information can be maintained, managed, and accessed on
a network-wide basis. Sun supports the LDAP naming service. Without such a service,
each <a href="#glossary-124">system</a> has to maintain its own copy of the system information in
the local <tt>/etc</tt> files.</p><a name="glossary-86"></a><b>networked systems</b><p>A group of systems that are connected through hardware and software, sometimes referred
to as a local area network (LAN). One or more servers are usually
needed when systems are networked.</p><a name="glossary-89"></a><b>non-networked systems</b><p>Computers that are not connected to a network or do not rely on
other hosts.</p><a name="glossary-90"></a><b>open network</b><p>A network of Solaris Trusted Extensions hosts that is connected physically to other
networks and that uses Trusted Extensions software to communicate with non-Trusted Extensions hosts.
Contrast with <a href="#glossary-18">closed network</a>.</p><a name="glossary-93"></a><b>outside the evaluated configuration</b><p>When software that has been proved to be able satisfy the criteria for
an <a href="#glossary-42">evaluated configuration</a>, is configured with settings that do not satisfy security criteria, the
software is described as being <b>outside the evaluated configuration</b>.</p><a name="glossary-96"></a><b>permission bits</b><p>A type of <a href="#glossary-31">discretionary access control</a> in which the owner specifies a set of
bits to signify who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.
Three different sets of permissions are assigned to each file or directory: one
set for the owner, one set for the owner's group, and one set
for all others.</p><a name="glossary-146"></a><b>primary administrator</b><p>The person who is entrusted to create new <a href="#glossary-54">rights profile</a>s for the organization,
and to fix machine difficulties that are beyond the power of the <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a>
and <a href="#glossary-125">system administrator</a> combined. This role should be assumed rarely. After initial security configuration,
more secure sites can choose not to create this role, and not to
assign any role the Primary Administrator profile.</p><a name="glossary-99"></a><b>privilege</b><p>Powers that are granted to a process that is executing a command. The
full set of privileges describes the full capabilities of the system, from basic
capabilities to administrative capabilities. Privileges that bypass <a href="#glossary-113">security policy</a>, such as setting the
clock on a system, can be granted by a site's <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a>.</p><a name="glossary-100"></a><b>process</b><p>An action that executes a command on behalf of the user who invokes
the command. A process receives a number of <a href="#glossary-112">security attribute</a>s from the user,
including the user ID (UID), the group ID (GID), the supplementary group list,
and the user's audit ID (AUID).  Security attributes received by a process
include any <a href="#glossary-99">privilege</a>s that are available to the command being executed and the <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a>
of the current workspace.</p><a name="glossary-102"></a><b>profile shell</b><p>A special shell that recognizes <a href="#glossary-99">privilege</a>s. A profile shell typically limits users
to fewer commands, but can allow these commands to run with privilege. The
profile shell is the default shell of a <a href="#glossary-131">trusted role</a>.</p><a name="glossary-103"></a><b>remote host</b><p>A different system than the local system. A remote host can be an
<a href="#glossary-137">unlabeled host</a> or a <a href="#glossary-68">labeled host</a>.</p><a name="glossary-54"></a><b>rights profile</b><p>A bundling mechanism for commands and CDE actions and for the <a href="#glossary-112">security attribute</a>s that
are assigned to these executables. Rights profiles allow Solaris administrators to control who can
execute which commands and to control the attributes these commands have when they
are executed. When a user logs in, all rights assigned to that user
are in effect, and the user has access to all the commands,
CDE actions, and <a href="#glossary-9">authorization</a>s assigned in all of that user's rights profiles.</p><a name="glossary-104"></a><b>role</b><p>A role is like a user, except that a role cannot log
in. Typically, a role is used to assign administrative capabilities. Roles are limited
to a particular set of commands and CDE actions. See <a href="#glossary-5">administrative role</a>.</p><a name="glossary-111"></a><b>security administrator</b><p>In an organization where sensitive information must be protected, the person or persons
who define and enforce the site's <a href="#glossary-113">security policy</a>. These persons are cleared to access
all information that is being processed at the site. In software, the Security
Administrator <a href="#glossary-5">administrative role</a> is assigned to one or more individuals who have the proper
<a href="#glossary-16">clearance</a>. These administrators configure the <a href="#glossary-112">security attribute</a>s of all users and hosts so that the
software enforces the site's security policy. In contrast, see <a href="#glossary-125">system administrator</a>.</p><a name="glossary-112"></a><b>security attribute</b><p>An attribute that is used to enforce Trusted Extensions <a href="#glossary-113">security policy</a>. Various sets
of security attributes are assigned to <a href="#glossary-100">process</a>es, users, zones, hosts, allocatable <a href="#glossary-28">device</a>s, and other objects.</p><a name="glossary-24"></a><b>security label set</b><p>Specifies a discrete set of security labels for a <a href="#glossary-129">tnrhtp database</a> entry. Hosts
that are assigned to a template with a security label set can send
and receive packets that match any one of the labels in the label
set.</p><a name="glossary-113"></a><b>security policy</b><p>On a Trusted Extensions host, the set of <a href="#glossary-26">DAC</a>, <a href="#glossary-74">MAC</a>, and labeling rules
that define how information can be accessed.  At a customer site, the
set of rules that define the sensitivity of the information being processed at
that site and the measures that are used to protect the information from
unauthorized access.</p><a name="glossary-114"></a><b>sensitivity label</b><p>A security <a href="#glossary-66">label</a> that is assigned to an object or a process. The
label is used to limit access according to the security level of the
data that is contained.</p><a name="glossary-144"></a><b>Solaris Management Console</b><p>A Java-based administrative GUI that contains <a href="#glossary-145">toolbox</a>es of administrative programs. In Trusted
CDE, this GUI can be launched from the Application Manager. Most system, network, and
user administration is done by using the Console toolboxes.</p><a name="glossary-124"></a><b>system</b><p>Generic name for a computer. After installation, a system on a network is
often referred to as a host.</p><a name="glossary-123"></a><b>system accreditation range</b><p>The set of all valid <a href="#glossary-66">label</a>s that are created according to the rules
that the <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a> defines in the <a href="#glossary-69">label_encodings file</a>, plus the two administrative <a href="#glossary-66">label</a>s that
are used on every system that is configured with Trusted Extensions. The administrative
labels are <tt>ADMIN_LOW</tt> and <tt>ADMIN_HIGH</tt>.</p><a name="glossary-125"></a><b>system administrator</b><p>In Trusted Extensions, the <a href="#glossary-131">trusted role</a> assigned to the user or users who
are responsible for performing standard system management tasks such as setting up the
non-security-relevant portions of user accounts. In contrast, see <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a>.</p><a name="glossary-128"></a><b>tnrhdb database</b><p>The trusted network remote host database. This database assigns a set of label
characteristics to a remote host. The database is accessible either as a file
in <tt>/etc/security/tsol/tnrhdb</tt> or from the LDAP server.</p><a name="glossary-129"></a><b>tnrhtp database</b><p>The trusted network remote host template. This database defines the set of label
characteristics that a remote host can be assigned. The database is accessible either
as a file in <tt>/etc/security/tsol/tnrhtp</tt>,  or from the LDAP server.</p><a name="glossary-145"></a><b>toolbox</b><p>A collection of programs in the <a href="#glossary-144">Solaris Management Console</a>. On a Trusted Extensions host,
administrators use <tt>Policy=TSOL</tt> toolboxes. Each toolbox has programs that are usable in the
scope of the toolbox. For example, the Trusted Network Zones tool, which handles
the system's <tt>tnzonecfg</tt> database, exists only in the <tt>Files</tt> toolbox, because its scope
is always local. The User Accounts program exists in all toolboxes. To create
a local user, the administrator uses the <tt>Files</tt> toolbox, and to create a network
user, the administrator uses the <tt>LDAP</tt> toolbox.</p><a name="glossary-130"></a><b>Trusted Network databases</b><p><tt>tnrhtp</tt>, the trusted network remote host template and <tt>tnrhdb</tt>, the trusted network remote
host database together define the <a href="#glossary-103">remote host</a>s that a Trusted Extensions system can communicate with.</p><a name="glossary-131"></a><b>trusted role</b><p>See <a href="#glossary-5">administrative role</a>.</p><a name="glossary-133"></a><b>trusted stripe</b><p>A region that cannot be spoofed. In Trusted CDE, the trusted stripe is
at the bottom of the screen, and in Trusted JDS the stripe
can be at the top. The stripe provides visual feedback about the state
of the window system: a trusted path indicator and window <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a>. When <a href="#glossary-114">sensitivity label</a>s are
configured to not be viewable for a user, the trusted stripe is
reduced to an icon that displays only the trusted path indicator.</p><a name="glossary-147"></a><b>txzonemgr script</b><p>The <tt>/usr/sbin/txzonemgr</tt> script provides a simple GUI for managing labeled zones. The script
provides contextual menus with appropriate choices. <tt>txzonemgr</tt> is run by root in the global
zone.</p><a name="glossary-137"></a><b>unlabeled host</b><p>A system that sends unlabeled network packets, such as a system that is
running the Solaris OS.</p><a name="glossary-138"></a><b>user accreditation range</b><p>The set of all possible labels at which a regular user can work
on the <a href="#glossary-124">system</a>. The site's <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a> specifies the range in the <a href="#glossary-69">label_encodings file</a> file.
The rules for well-formed <a href="#glossary-66">label</a>s that define the <a href="#glossary-123">system accreditation range</a> are additionally restricted by the values
in the <tt>ACCREDITATION RANGE</tt> section of the file: the upper bound, the lower bound,
the combination constraints and other restrictions.</p><a name="glossary-139"></a><b>user clearance</b><p>The <a href="#glossary-16">clearance</a> assigned by the <a href="#glossary-111">security administrator</a> that sets the upper bound of the set
of <a href="#glossary-66">label</a>s at which a user can work at any time. The user
can decide to accept the default, or can further restrict that clearance during
any particular login session.</p>
