[NOTE]
====
**When using these books, please bear in mind:**

* The OpenIndiana Project has republished these books primarily for their reference value.
* Although vast portions of these books are still relevant, significant divergence has occurred between OpenIndiana Hipster and OpenSolaris/Solaris Express.
* Some of the books in this collection reference publications which were either never open-sourced by Sun Microsystems or never released by the OpenSolaris Project.
**  For example, the _OpenSolaris Developer's Reference Guide_ was never released as part of this collection.
  However, the illumos project has published a similar title: https://illumos.org/books/dev/[The illumos Developer's Guide]
* There are lots of broken links to OpenSolaris.org and Sun Microsystems.
* In some cases, it may be possible to follow broken links by using the https://archive.org/web/[Internet Archive Wayback Machine].
