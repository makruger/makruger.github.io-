== Contributing to OpenIndiana Docs 


toc::[levels=2]


There are multiple ways community members can contribute to the OpenIndiana Documentation revitalization effort.
These contributions fall into several different roles:

=== Content Creator

The easiest way to help the docs revitalization effort is by writing content.
The content creator would (as the title suggests) develop content to be hosted on the docs website.
Content could include just about anything, news posts, tutorials, Howto's, or larger efforts such as the handbook or updating the OSOL books.

The nice thing about helping with content creation is the level of commitment is entirely up to the individual.
In other words, there is no requirement to get involved in anything major.
In contrast, it would probably be better to start small and only later consider taking on something larger.
Required skills would include a willingness to write, and a willingness to work with content reviewers.

=== Content Reviewer

The content reviewer would effectively perform the role of editorial reviewer.
This person would review pull request and provide editorial feedback to content creators.
This role would also engage with the website developer to help place content appropriately as well as assist the website developer with site organization.
Helpful skills would include good organization and people skills as well as a knack for performing editorial reviews.

=== Website Developer

The docs website developer would work with content creators and content reviewers helping to improve site functionality and organization.
This role requires front end web development skills and would be working directly with the Awestruct framework.
Helpful skills would include experience with Ruby, HAML, HTML, and CSS.
The website developer would also be working with Awestruct extensions and helpers which may also include working directly with the Awestruct API.


== Why Fresh Website Content is so Important

Good docs and a steady stream of fresh content helps to inspire confidence in the OpenIndiana project.
These things also help show the project is alive and thriving.

Here are a couple of end user quotes which serve as a reminder:


.User Comment Posted to the OI Wiki in 2011

[quote]
Documentation such as a manual is essential in not just learning from, it tells everyone where the product is in the scheme of things.
Referring to Oracle for documentation relating to OI just makes one have less confidence with OI itself.
Look at the FreeBSD site documentation levels are really good and gives people confidence to try FreeBSD and its derivatives.

.User Comment Posted to the FreeBSD Forum in 2013

[quote]
FreeBSD has been around almost as long as Unix itself existed (not entirely true, but you get the idea) and same can be said for Solaris as it was.
Yet the OpenSolaris group basically still has to prove themselves.
For all I know (from a commercial point of view) they could be gone next month.
That makes it a liability, especially in comparison to Sun being out of the picture and the love/hate relationship with Oracle.


== How to get started with content creation


While it's true there are some major projects that need love, helping out with one doesn't mean you have to write the entire thing yourself.

* Pick a doc and tackle a single section.
* Pick a doc and add in some TODO's where they are obviously needed.
* Add new sectional placeholders.
* Look for ways to improve the clarity of what is already written.
* File GitHub issues offering new ideas, suggestions for improvement, or recommendations for new doc titles.
* Write about writing (how to write more effectively, how to write for an international audience, How to get past writer's block, etc.).


=== Smaller Works

* Writing a news story
* Writing a blog post
* Writing a tutorial
* Writing an episode of Hipster news
* Expanding FAQ
* Documenting the documentation process


=== Larger Works

* User Handbook
* Developer Handbook
* Updating and or consolidating the OpenSolaris books


== Suggested Subjects to Write About (Tutorials, etc.)

This is just a short list of some suggested subjects to write about.
But don't limit yourself to this small list.
Write about anything you want.
Most importantly, write about what interests you or what you think may interest others.
Look through the existing docs for TODO's and tackle one of them.
Write some new TODO's.


=== ABI support

* Write about the change from Sun Studio to GCC its implications for ABI from previous Solaris releases/OpenSolaris, etc.
** For more details, see: http://openindiana.org/pipermail/oi-dev/2014-December/003496.html
** We might also want to talk about what other effects (if any) have/will result from the move to OI-Userland  


=== Installing OI onto an ISCSI exposed SCSI target

A good tutorial might be to write about installing OpenIndiana Hipster on an ISCSI target.

[source, console]
----
[14:50:02] <alp> does someone have some links on "installing OI on ISCSI" ?
[14:57:40] <tsoome> alp get to illumos wiki, open projects loader -> ideas, from there you get link for jeffpc iscsi experiment
[14:57:46] <tsoome> I did use it to play with ipxe+iscsi+loader
----

Also can look at Oracle docs for reference: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29008/iscsi-1.html


=== Write some comparision tables

* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and other illumos distros.
* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and other BSD distros (PCBSD in relation to freebsd, etc.)
* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and Linux, etc. (Linux kernel and GNU userland, illumos kernel and GNU userland, etc.)
** See: https://web.archive.org/web/20090904201802/http://wikis.sun.com/display/SolarisDeveloper/Migrating+from+Linux+to+Solaris+or+OpenSolaris
* Command comparison tables â€“ e.g. if such and such command does something on Linux, Windows, BSD, etc., use such and such command to do same thing on OI.
** For some inspiration, see the tables found on the SmartOS Wiki.
** Oracle might have some inspiration as well - (just don't copy it verbatim)


=== Write about Virtualization

* add a page about running OI as a virtual guest in Virtualbox, vmware, KVM, talk about which provides the best hardware support, guest tools compatibility, other caveats, etc.
