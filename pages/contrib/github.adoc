=== Introduction

As the OpenIndiana Docs website is still a proof of concept technology demonstration, its Github repository remains under the private control of the original author.
If the concept is approved for inclusion under OpenIndiana GitHub organizational umbrella, then it will have an official repository.

Meanwhile, you can find the OpenIndiana Docs repository here: https://github.com/makruger/website

The repository consists of 2 branches:

* master
* gh-pages

Development occurs in the master branch and the site is published to the gh-pages branch, where the content becomes available via GitHub Pages.
