=== Introduction

This is just a short list of some suggested subjects to write about.
Please don't limit yourself to this small list.
Write about anything you want.
Most importantly, write about what interests you or what you think may interest others.
Look through the existing docs for TODO's and tackle one of them.
Write some new TODO's.

=== Translations

Consider helping to translate important documents and website pages.
For example, the primary OpenIndiana.org site now has a translation menu which needs populating.


=== ABI support

* Write about the change from Sun Studio to GCC its implications for ABI from previous Solaris releases/OpenSolaris, etc.
** For more details, see: http://openindiana.org/pipermail/oi-dev/2014-December/003496.html
** We might also want to talk about what other effects (if any) have/will result from the move to OI-Userland  


=== Installing OI onto an ISCSI exposed SCSI target

A good tutorial might be to write about installing OpenIndiana Hipster on an ISCSI target.

[source, console]
----
[14:50:02] <alp> does someone have some links on "installing OI on ISCSI" ?
[14:57:40] <tsoome> alp get to illumos wiki, open projects loader -> ideas, from there you get link for jeffpc iscsi experiment
[14:57:46] <tsoome> I did use it to play with ipxe+iscsi+loader
----

Also can look at Oracle docs for reference: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29008/iscsi-1.html


=== Write some comparision tables

* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and other illumos distros.
* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and other BSD distros (PCBSD in relation to freebsd, etc.)
* Provide some contrast/comparisons between OI and Linux, etc. (Linux kernel and GNU userland, illumos kernel and GNU userland, etc.)
** See: https://web.archive.org/web/20090904201802/http://wikis.sun.com/display/SolarisDeveloper/Migrating+from+Linux+to+Solaris+or+OpenSolaris
* Command comparison tables â€“ e.g. if such and such command does something on Linux, Windows, BSD, etc., use such and such command to do same thing on OI.
** For some inspiration, see the tables found on the SmartOS Wiki.
** Oracle might have some inspiration as well - (just don't copy it verbatim)


=== Write about Virtualization

* add a page about running OI as a virtual guest in Virtualbox, vmware, KVM, talk about which provides the best hardware support, guest tools compatibility, other caveats, etc.
