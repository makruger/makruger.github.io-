== Content Management - The BSD Approach


toc::[levels=2]


Here we take a quick look at PC-BSD and FreeBSD projects and examine their approaches to content management.

=== Examining the BSD Websites and Handbooks


==== PCBSD

.Website
* website: http://www.pcbsd.org/
* Well laid out, clutter free.
* Download buttons are present right on home page. 
* Hosted on WordPress

.Handbook
* handbook: http://web.pcbsd.org/doc-archive/10.2/html/pcbsd.html
* Nice intuitive navigation pane on left side - (Newer versions allow navigation pane to be toggled out of the way)
* Clutter free as it only shows one section at a time.
* Lots of color, bold text, large fonts, lots of screen shots, etc.
* Breadcrumbs on top, but not on bottom.
* example of their handbook page source: http://web.pcbsd.org/doc-archive/10.2/html/_sources/install.txt
* Very simple [http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html[reStructuredText markup] - Similar to ASCIIDOC or Creole


==== FreeBSD 

.Website
* website - https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/
* well defined and well organized navigational dropdowns
* Lots of color used to delineate one piece of information from another
* Very consistent style used throughout entire website

.Handbook
* Handbook - https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/book.html
* Red text used for hyperlinks
* grey boxes used to delineate columns of information from each other.
* Each page has it's own navigational breadcrumbs (top and bottom, left and right)


=== What can we learn from this?

.The BSD Websites
* Both of the BSD websites are very fresh and modern.
* Navigation is very straitforward and intuitive.
* Information is clearly deliniated.
* Clutter free.
* Neither project is using a wiki, rather all content is served from the same location.


.PCBSD Handbook
* The PCBSD Project is using http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html[Sphinx] for their handbook.
* Python Project also uses restructuredtext based Sphinx for their documentation (you'll notice the similarities).
* Skill level required for contributing to docs project is much lower than it would be for docbook
* The PCBSD handbook is searchable (Sphinx uses several javascripts to do this).
* The PCBSD Handbook is hosted as static HTML.

.FreeBSD Handbook
* The FreeBSD Project is using http://www.docbook.org/[Docbook] for their handbook.
* Sun used solbook (derived from docbook).
Redhat most likely uses Docbook as well.
* Skill level required to contribute to docs project is somewhat higher than it would be for restructuredtext based Sphinx.
* The FreeBSD handbook is not searchable.
* The FreeBSD Handbook is hosted as static HTML.
