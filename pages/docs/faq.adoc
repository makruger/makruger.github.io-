== The OpenIndiana FAQ

=== What is OpenIndiana?

The OpenIndiana project is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenIndiana[OpenIndiana] distribution, an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumos[illumos] based Unix-like operating system derived from OpenSolaris.
The purpose of the OpenIndiana Project is to ensure the continued availability of an openly developed distribution based on OpenSolaris.
The OpenIndiana project is also a continuation of the collaborative effort and community spirit of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris[OpenSolaris project].

For a comprehensive history of the OpenSolaris project, see Jim Grisanzio's https://jimgrisanzio.wordpress.com/opensolaris/[OpenSolaris timeline].

=== Why is it called OpenIndiana?

OpenIndiana obtains its name from Project Indiana, an open source effort by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) to produce OpenSolaris, a community developed Unix-like distribution based on Sun Solaris.
Project Indiana was led by Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian Linux Distribution.


=== How are OpenIndiana and illumos related?

The https://illumos.org[illumos project] is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports  https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate[illumos-gate], the core software used by the OpenIndiana distribution.
Similar to a BSD `src` tree, illumos-gate includes the illumos kernel, along with many of the device drivers, core libraries, and system utilities.

To form a complete distribution, the OpenIndiana project combines illumos-gate with oi-userland, and with other free and open-source software.
This melding of software from many different open-source projects is similar to how Linux distributions use the Linux kernel along with software from the GNU and various other open source projects. 


=== How does OpenIndiana differ from OpenSolaris?

Some of the differences between OpenIndiana and OpenSolaris can be characterized as follows:

* Sun/Oracle's proprietary OS/NET consolidation has been replaced with https://github.com/OpenIndiana/illumos-gate[illumos-gate].
* Many of the original OpenSolaris software consolidations have been reorganized into a single https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland[oi-userland] consolidation.
* Oracle's Sun Studio has been replaced with the open source GNU GCC compiler.
* XVM (XEN) has been replaced with the illumos-kvm port.

[NOTE]
OpenIndiana Hipster's transition from Sun Studio to GCC has resulted in a discontinuance of ABI (binary) compatibility with previous releases of OpenIndiana, Oracle Solaris, and OpenSolaris.
Applications coded in the `C` language should continue to work normally.
Therefore, this change only affects applications written in the `C++` language.

=== How does OpenIndiana compare to BSD or Linux?


// TODO
// Write a table providing a matrix comparing commands between BSD/Linux/OpenIndiana.
// See: https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/ITDOC/Major+difference+between+Linux+and+Solaris
// Also can look at old OpenSolaris website for ideas, suggestions, etc.


All of these operating systems follow the Unix paradigm and contain tools and commands which bear a similar resemblance, although specific feature sets and command usage may be dissimilar.
If you are coming to OpenIndiana from either BSD or Linux, you will quickly learn these differences.
In no time at all, you'll feel right at home working with OpenIndiana's tools and commands.


=== What features does OpenIndiana have?

OpenIndiana contains the following enterprise class features and more:
