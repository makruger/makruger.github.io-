== Building a Document Management Toolchain using Sphinx


toc::[levels=2]


=== Introduction

This article looks at the Sphinx documentation management framework and how it could be used as part of a document management toolchain.
Sphinx is a python based docs framework and uses RestructuredText as it's text markup language.

.System Characteristics
* Easy to use
* TOC is easy to navigate.
* Produces a very professional looking end product.
* Processes text markup into highly polished, searchable and indexed HTML docs (as well as PDF and EPUB).
* Produces chunked HTML by means of pulling together several smaller documents into one larger document.

.Editing tools
* As a text markup any text editor can be used.
* There is a VIM plugin for RestructuredTEXT named RIV, which provides text folding, syntax highlighting, etc., but it's rather buggy.
* Another available plugin is InstantRST which provides a realtime text parsing webserver to provide you realtime feedback for your edits. 


=== Tool chain installation

You can install Sphinx on OpenIndiana Hipster, but latex is required for converting documents to PDF.
I'm not sure whether latex is available on Hipster.

.Linux Mint 17.2
* `sudo apt-get install git`
* `sudo apt-get install python-sphinx`
* `pip install https://github.com/Rykka/instant-rst.py/archive/master.zip`

.OpenIndiana Hipster
* `pkg install git`
* `pkg install pip`
* `pip install sphinx`
* `pip install https://github.com/Rykka/instant-rst.py/archive/master.zip`

.Setup VIM for using Sphinx
* Configure Vundle for VIM (Vundle is used to manage VIM plugins)
** backup your VIM configuration by renaming your existing .vimrc and .vim folder
** `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
** Configure .vimrc for vundle per: https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
* Add plugins to .vimrc and use vundle to install the plugins
** Configure .vimrc for `Plugin 'Rykka/riv.vim'`
** Configure .vimrc for `Plugin 'Rykka/InstantRst'`
** From within VIM, run `:PluginInstall` to process/install the plugins


=== Using Sphinx

.Getting Started
* Create a new repository on GitHub.
* Clone your repository to your local machine.
* cd into the directory creating by `git clone`.
* Configure Sphinx
** `sphinx-quickstart`  (Note: For help on this, see the Sphinx website, which explains all the options.)

.Writing your docs
* Write your docs using RestructuredTEXT - (See the Sphinx webstie for guidance)
** Sphinx docs use the .rst file name extension.
* Add finished doc file names to the _Table of Contents_ (TOC) which is located in `Index.rst`.

.Add work products to GIT
* Create and configure a `.gitignore` as appropriate.
* `git status`
* `git add <file(s)>`
* `git commit`
* `git push`

.Process your docs into HTML
* Generate html output by executing the command `make html` from within the Sphinx `_build` directory.
** Finished docs are found in the `_build/html` directory. 
** Images, css, javascript, etc., are found in `_build/html/_static`
** Source RestructuredTEXT files are copied to `_build/html/_source`

.Share your work
* When satisfied with HTML output, submit git pull requests to other members of the doc team.
* When doc team is satisfied with state of GitHub repository, a member of the doc team would clone the repository and generate the final HTML for display on the OI website.
